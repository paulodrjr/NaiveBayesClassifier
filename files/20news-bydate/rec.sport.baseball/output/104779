from: jfc@athena.mit.edu (john f carr) subject: re: proposed catcher re-sub rule organization: massachusetts institute of technology lines: 11 nntp-posting-host: achates.mit.edu the red sox usually have 2 catchers. i don't think they have a backup now, but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle infielder and outfielder. you don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field. -- john carr (jfc@athena.mit.edu)
