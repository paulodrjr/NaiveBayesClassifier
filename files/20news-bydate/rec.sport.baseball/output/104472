from: cs902060@ariel.yorku.ca (geoffrey e dias) subject: attention anyone in syracuse ny or richmond va organization: york university, toronto, canada lines: 13 there are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the jays' farm system or the braves'. his name is bill taylor. he was picked up by the jays, but had to be offered back to the braves before they were able to send him to the syracuse chiefs. one report says that the braves took him back and assigned him to richmond. the other says that he is on the chiefs' roster. which one is right?
