from: ada41546@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (driftwood) subject: re: jim lefebvre is an idiot. article-i.d.: news.c51uc6.bl1 organization: university of illinois at urbana lines: 9 i totally agree with each point you made. jose viscaino looked like a single a hitter up there. who swings on 3-1 count with maddux pitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all day. i also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing. watching the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about what the cubs should be doing than lefebre does. harry said it best when he stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait til sandberg returns!
