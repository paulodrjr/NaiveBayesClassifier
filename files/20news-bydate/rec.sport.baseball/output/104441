from: davewood@bruno.cs.colorado.edu (david rex wood) subject: rockies need some relief nntp-posting-host: bruno.cs.colorado.edu organization: university of colorado, boulder lines: 13 once again, the rockies bullpen fell apart. andy ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run. then game the dreaded relief. three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each i believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity. (final was 4-2 vs expos). despite their problems in the pen, i think the rockies are a team that wont be taken lightly. going into today's game, the had the league's leading hitter and rbi man (galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (young and cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- david rex wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- university of colorado at boulder -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
