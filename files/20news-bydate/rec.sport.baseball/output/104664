from: dkl@cs.arizona.edu (david k. lowenthal) subject: re: braves & giants organization: u of arizona cs dept, tucson lines: 13 >> the situation with the giants' bleachers is a case in point for the >>need for a commissioner. this is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. selig needs to do is to suspend bobby cox. you *cannot* allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did. i usually rip umps, but in this case, the players were dead wrong. cox should go for 5 games. if i had ever umped a game where that happened, i'd have ejected every player that came out. only cox and gant would have been spared, and then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument. --dave
