from: jrogoff@scott.skidmore.edu (jay rogoff) subject: box score abbrev woes organization: skidmore college, saratoga springs ny lines: 7 can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense? (at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door.) i must have stared at "cleman" in the mets' box for a good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was. wouldn't it make more sense to use "colemn"? jay
