subject: quick way to tell if your local beat writer is dumb. from: gajarsky@pilot.njin.net (bob gajarsky - hobokenite) organization: somewhere in hoboken lines: 10 jayson stark (i trhink that's him) fits perfectly in this category. anyone who writes "dean palmer has 2 homers - at this pace, he'll have 324 home runs!" should be shot. if, at the end of april, he has 11, and anyone writes "at this pace, he'll have 100+ homers!" they shouldbe shot too. - bob gaj
