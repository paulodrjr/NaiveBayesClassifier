subject: the 1964 phillies: deja vu? from: csc2imd@cabell.vcu.edu (ian m. derby) expires: mon, 10 may 1993 04:00:00 gmt organization: virginia commonwealth university keywords: phillies summary: phillies lines: 9 after reading my local paper today, i found out that the phillies started the 1964 season at 10-2. i am not as old as 1964, but i've heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season. they were ahead of the cardinals by 15 games that season in mid-august. they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division. 15!!! games ahead and lost it.... i hope this season is much different.
