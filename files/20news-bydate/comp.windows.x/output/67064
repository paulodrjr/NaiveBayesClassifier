from: weisberg@ee.rochester.edu (jeff weisberg) subject: problem: r5 server hangs on sun3 summary: annoying problem, server hangs keywords: x11r5pl22, sun3, bw2, 4.1.1, gcc-2.3.3, xsun, vernal equinox organization: univ. of rochester, dept. of electrical engineering lines: 19 i recently compiled the x11r5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on a sun3/80. everything seems to work fine. usually. but at seemingly random times the server will just hang. i will click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned), and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server to be killed. sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes only for minutes. (os: 4.1.1; frame buffer: bw2). has anyone seen this before, any ideas? (anything at all?) thanks, --jeff --- jeff weisberg | weisberg@ee.rochester.edu | real cherries, | ur-valhalla!weisberg | watch for pits!
