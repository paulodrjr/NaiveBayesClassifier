from: kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov (kevin b. weinrich) subject: solution: why do i need "xrdb -m" when .xdefaults unchanged? organization: computer sciences corp. lines: 9 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: helios.ath.epa.gov the short answer seems to be: "i don't". the particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults if *any* of them are missing from the .xdefaults file. once i added the missing ones to the .xdefaults file, the problem goes away. -kevin -- kevin weinrich computer sciences corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov
