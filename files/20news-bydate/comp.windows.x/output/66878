from: coe@leopard.cs.uidaho.edu (mike coe) subject: window manager organization: /users/student/coe/.organization lines: 19 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: leopard.cs.uidaho.edu i currently use a window manager called ctwm which is very similar to hp's vuewm. (i.e. it has multiple workspaces). is there a motif based window manager that has this same feature and is not a memory pig like vue? mike -- michael l coe | "a mind is a terrible thing." laboratory of applied logic | university of idaho | coe@leopard.cs.uidaho.edu | coe861@snake.cs.uidaho.edu
