from: ewang@ucsee.berkeley.edu (edward wang) subject: widget source code needed organization: university of california, berkeley lines: 10 nntp-posting-host: ucsee.berkeley.edu i'm considering writing my own widgets, but i like to have some sample widget source code to look over first. where could i find something like this? are there any archives accessible by anonymous ftp that contain such information? thanks, edward
