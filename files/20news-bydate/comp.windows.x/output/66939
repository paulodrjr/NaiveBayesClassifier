subject: mit r5 on sun with rasterops tc colorboard from: mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz (mark davies) distribution: world organization: dept. of comp. sci., victoria uni. of wellington, new zealand. nntp-posting-host: bats.comp.vuw.ac.nz lines: 9 is it possible to run an mit r5 based xserver on a sun with a rasterops tc colorboard (24bit board)? i have the xsun24 patches for supporting sun's 24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or something else? i know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be buying one to put in an ipx. cheers mark
