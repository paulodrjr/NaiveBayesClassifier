from: xyzzy@hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu (daniel drucker) subject: tape down selections article-i.d.: hal.1r4cej$1jc8 organization: dis lines: 11 nntp-posting-host: hal.ai.mit.edu i just had an idea. i'm not sure if its been done and i'm just remembering it unconsiously, but i thought that in dialog boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or filled in a certain way. my idea: tape. you know, like putting a piece of tape over a light switch? just an idea, if you like it, use it. -- daniel drucker n2sxx | xyzzy@gnu.ai.mit.edu forever, forever, my coda. | und2dzd@vaxc.hofstra.edu
