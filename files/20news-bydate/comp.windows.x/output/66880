from: donaldlf@k9.rose-hulman.edu (leslie f. donaldson) subject: problems using graphic context with athena widgets organization: rose-hulman institute of technology lines: 15 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: k9.cs.rose-hulman.edu keywords: athena,colormaps,graphic contex i am creating a graphics program using the athena widgets. i use xlib routines to install a custom graphics contex by obtaining the display, and window variables with the xtwindowofobject() and xtdisplayofobject(). the object was one of the sub widgets. the problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. i tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed. i am preforming all of this manipulation before calling xtappmainloop(). thank you for any help. leslie donaldson donaldlf@cs.rose-hulman.edu donaldlf@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu
