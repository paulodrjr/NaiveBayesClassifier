from: ian@csc.liv.ac.uk (ian finch) subject: which x events are generated on application exit? organization: knee deep in sky high lines: 18 nntp-posting-host: rib.csc.liv.ac.uk x-newsreader: tin [version 1.1 pl9] i'm writing an application running under x (using motif), and i need to do some stuff when the application quits. now, when i shut down my x windows session, it doesn't seem to send a sigterm (or whatever) signal to my application (i'm trapping various signals like that). therefore, i thought i could use an x signal to check for my top level window being destroyed. however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows. is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed (some field to check or some combination of events?). replies by e-mail please and i will summarise. thanks for any help, ian -- // // // ian@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk // // //
