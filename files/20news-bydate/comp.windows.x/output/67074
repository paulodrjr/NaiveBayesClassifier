(it's named glib.c; my ibm's down right now though, so i can't find the exact location :) warning: this code feels quite bogus. it does things like calling noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an x window id from it anyway. it worked just fine under aix 3.1; i spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's turning into a hard job. check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and x, and how to go about doing so. )rob
