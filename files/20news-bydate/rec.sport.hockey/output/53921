from: icop@csa.bu.edu (antonio pera) subject: hockey & the hispanic community distribution: usa organization: computer science department, boston university, boston, ma, usa lines: 6 originator: icop@csa relying on canadian tourists and transplanted northeasterners to support a team in miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving cities without a team such as san diego & milwaukee. i wish the panthers or whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to hispanics, they're in deep doo-doo. already, there are rumors that tampa may move to milwaukee.
