from: gp2011@andy.bgsu.edu (george pavlic) subject: re: ron francis organization: bowling green state university b.g., oh. lines: 10 not to mention, mr. francis is an incredibly nice person. over christmas break, a friend of mine had a little xmas gathering. the two of us drove to ron's house. while i stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went to the door and rang the bell. ron answered and my friend introduced himself. he then proceeded to invite francis to the party. ron declined because he "had to watch his daughter." he then reached out and shook my friend's hand! i know this isn't r.s.b., but i don't think barry bonds would be this polite in this situation. george
