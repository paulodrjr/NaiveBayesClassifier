from: fragante@unixg.ubc.ca (gv fragante) subject: vesa lb - what is bus mastering organization: the university of british columbia lines: 12 nntp-posting-host: unixg.ubc.ca i read an article about the benefits of a vlb motherboard. it said that a true vlb board supports bus mastering, otherwise it is just as good as an isa motherboard. doesn't all vlb motherboard support bus mastering? i just bought a 486-33 vlb and the tech manual does not explicitly state the words "local bus mastering" but it said it "supports bus master and slave modes". are these terms synonymous? thanks. ps. - please reply by e-mail as i don't read this newgroup often.
