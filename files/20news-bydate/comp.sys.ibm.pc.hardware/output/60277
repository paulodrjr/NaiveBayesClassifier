from: jon@umcc.umcc.umich.edu (jon zeeff) subject: s3 video card at different address organization: umcc, ann arbor, mi lines: 7 distribution: usa nntp-posting-host: umcc.umcc.umich.edu i'd like to add a second s3 based video card to my system. does anyone know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one? all i really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics on the other. probably just a configurable address would do it.
