from: tcking@uswnvg.com (tim king) subject: gateway 2000 & booting from floppy organization: ground zero lines: 17 x-newsreader: tin 1.1 pl5 i have a gateway 4dx-33v with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive a. i accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular box of diskettets in the a drive when i boot up, rather than getting the "non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the cmos gets overwritten (luckily, gateway sends a print of the standard cmos settings with their systems). this only happens with a box of pre-formatted fuji disks that i have, no other disks cause this problem. if i re-format one of the fuji disks, the problem goes away. i did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing. anyone have any idea what is going on here? hardware problem? a virus that can't be detected? the system reading in garbage from the boot sector? -- tim king, tcking@uswnvg.com
