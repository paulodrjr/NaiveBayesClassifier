from: swartzjh@rosevc.rose-hulman.edu subject: custom keys organization: rose-hulman institute of technology lines: 8 reply-to: swartzjh@rosevc.rose-hulman.edu nntp-posting-host: hydra.rose-hulman.edu i am looking for a company that can make custom keys. for instance we need a key that says help, main menu, etc which we are going to use instead of f1,f2, f3 etc... can anyone point me to a company that does this. also do you have to have a special keyboard, or can i just pop off the old keys and pop in the new ones... thanks for the help jeff swartz
