(backing up masters) keywords: misled, confused, advice, comprendo! organization: university at buffalo lines: 8 news-software: vax/vms vnews 1.41 nntp-posting-host: ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu just a quick thanks to the many who explained the backing up of my masters. apparently they are not copy-protected; i just used a program that is unable to handle high-density (old shit). i was surprised to hear that "no programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone back there said. huh! learn something new every day! - mitch
