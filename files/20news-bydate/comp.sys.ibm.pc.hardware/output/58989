from: towwang@statler.engin.umich.edu (tow wang hui) subject: floppy file copying article-i.d.: srvr1.1pstlninn4r5 reply-to: towwang@engin.umich.edu distribution: world organization: university of michigan (caen) lines: 15 nntp-posting-host: statler.engin.umich.edu originator: towwang@statler.engin.umich.edu a silly question: i frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer is only equipped with one 3.5" hd drive and one 5.25" hd drive; can't i do the copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full) using standard msdos 5.0 commands? i know diskcopy a: a: works but for small selections of files, xcopy a:*.txt a: does not! maybe i'll have to write my own file copy command in c, but the idea does not amuse me. thanks for your help. francisco
