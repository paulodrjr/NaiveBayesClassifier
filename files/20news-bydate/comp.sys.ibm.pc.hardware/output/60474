from: arthur@hardy.u.washington.edu (howard roark) subject: problem with printer and emm386.exe!! article-i.d.: shelley.1qtbh0inn7nh distribution: world organization: university of washington, seattle lines: 8 nntp-posting-host: hardy.u.washington.edu i recently decided to try using emm386.exe for a memory manager and when i tried to print to my printer in lpt1 from word55 i wouldn't work. it would send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer ready light would go off and stop working. i disabled emm386.exe and the problem went away. i would like to continue using emm386.exe if possible. i would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions!! please send them to arthur@u.washingt, arthur@u.washington.edu
