from: bing@zinc.cchem.berkeley.edu (bing ho) subject: know anything about eisa-2? organization: uc berkeley lines: 11 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: zinc.cchem.berkeley.edu i read about the development of eisa-2 some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in vesa and pci. however, i recently was disheartened to hear that isa cannot address more than 16mb of ram, a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon. i recall that eisa-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements. is there such a standard being developed? -- bing ho bing@zinc.cchem.berkeley.edu university of california at berkeley
