from: meb4593@galileo.rtn.ca.boeing.com (michael bain) subject: what about no-fault? organization: boeing commercial airplane group, seattle lines: 14 insurance companies sure seem to go for no-fault coverage. since the majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a no-fault system? with a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the legal costs out of the system. but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed. -- michael "chuck" bain meb4593@icdfs.ca.boeing.com ---------------------------------------------------------------------- "semi-loud pipes save lives"
