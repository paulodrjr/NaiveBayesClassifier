(btw, a summary of bike(s) or plot is helpful but not necessary) thanx -erc. _______________________________________________________________________________ c eric sundheim csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu grandrapids, mi, usa `90 hondo vfr750f dod# 1138 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
