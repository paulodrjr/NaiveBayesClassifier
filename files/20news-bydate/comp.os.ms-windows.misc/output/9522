(i installed the mswin 3.1 multiresolution drivers which where supplied with the card ?!) would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card also if there are new(hopefully faster) drrivers around i would love to how to get hold of them :-) (ftp or whatsoever :-) ) gruss wolfgang
