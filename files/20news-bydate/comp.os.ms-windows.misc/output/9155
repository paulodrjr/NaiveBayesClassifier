from: ac151@freenet.carleton.ca (david clarke) subject: dos 6 / emm386 / windows 3.1 prob reply-to: ac151@freenet.carleton.ca (david clarke) organization: the national capital freenet lines: 22 has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging after the installation of dos 6? i have narrowed the problem down to emm386. if if remove (or disable) emm386, windows is ok. if emm386 is active, with noems, windows hangs. if i use auto with emm386, the system hangs on bootup. dave. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------- david clarke ...the well is deep...wish me well... ac151@freenet.carleton.ca david_clarke@mtsa.ubc.ca clarkec@sfu.ca -------------------------------------------------------------------
