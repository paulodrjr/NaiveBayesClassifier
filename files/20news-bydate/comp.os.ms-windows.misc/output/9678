from: wkwinkel@ibm.rz.uni-passau.de subject: re:color or monochrome? organization: university of passau - germany lines: 14 nntp-posting-host: ibm.rz.uni-passau.de walther, i'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. i'd only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. if this is not too small for your tastes at a 14".... personally i'd prefer the mono-screen as i always have quite a few windows open. if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color 'surplus' is worth trading in the smaller size. if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. i used a 14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen. regards, olaf winkelhake
