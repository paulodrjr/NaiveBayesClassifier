from: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (bill conner) subject: re: death penalty (was re: political atheists?) nntp-posting-host: okcforum.osrhe.edu organization: okcforum unix users group x-newsreader: tin [version 1.1 pl9] lines: 14 this is fascinating. atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality as a means of population control, insist that the only values are biological and condemn war and capital punishment. according to benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in this case means atheists i suppose. i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital punishment, i'm sorry but the logic escapes me. and why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the propriety of killing or of punishment? what is the basis of the ecomplaint? bill
