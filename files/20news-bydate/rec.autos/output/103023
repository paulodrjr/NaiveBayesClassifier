from: ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu (joni ciarletta) subject: master cylinder organization: university of southern california, los angeles, ca lines: 10 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: mizar.usc.edu thanks to everyone who responded to my honda accord break question. it does seem that the master cylinder is bad. i will have my mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it is very likely to be the master cylinder. thanks everyone!! joni
