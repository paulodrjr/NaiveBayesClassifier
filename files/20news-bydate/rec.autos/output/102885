from: gwalker@rtfm.mlb.fl.us (grayson walker) subject: re: changing oil by self. organization: a.s.i. n distribution: usa lines: 10 why crawl under the car at all? i have a machine i got for my boat that pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. it does an excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more old oil out than by using the drain plug. i think i paid $25 at e&b marine. the oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into your favorite device. i use soft drink bottles. easy to take them down to the local oil recycle center. forza!
