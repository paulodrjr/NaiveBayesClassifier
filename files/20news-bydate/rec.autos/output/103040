from: dduff@col.hp.com (dave duff) subject: re: waxing a new car organization: hp colorado springs division lines: 5 nntp-posting-host: fajita19.cs.itc.hp.com i just had my 41 chrysler painted. i was told to refrain from waxing it and to leave it out in the sun!! supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from the paint over a month or so (i can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains a little soft for a while.
