from: yongje@hardy.u.washington.edu (yong je lim) subject: dealer cheated me with wrong odometer reading. need help! organization: university of washington, seattle lines: 14 distribution: usa nntp-posting-host: hardy.u.washington.edu here is a story. i bought a car about two weeks ago. i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car. in between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero. therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage. that shows 35000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from. the dealer never told me anything about that important story. i hope that i can return the car with full refund. do u think this is possible? does anyone have similar experiences? any comments will be appreciated. thanks. yongje@u.washington.edu
