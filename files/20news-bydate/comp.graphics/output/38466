from: tdawson@engin.umich.edu (chris herringshaw) subject: newsgroup split organization: university of michigan engineering, ann arbor lines: 11 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: po.engin.umich.edu concerning the proposed newsgroup split, i personally am not in favor of doing this. i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group, from code to hardware to algorithms. i just think making 5 different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts a week per group. i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics. anyone else feel this way? just curious. daemon
