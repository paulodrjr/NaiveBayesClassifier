from: fineman@stein2.u.washington.edu (twixt your toes) subject: anyone know use "rayshade" out there? organization: university of washington lines: 12 nntp-posting-host: stein2.u.washington.edu keywords: rayshade, uw. i'm using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas. i could post uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested. i'm having trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel) from the rgb values. if you're on the u.w. machines, check out "~fineman/rle.files/*.rle" on stein.u.washington.edu for some of what i've got. dan
