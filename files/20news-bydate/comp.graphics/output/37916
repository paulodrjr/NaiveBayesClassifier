from: joth@ersys.edmonton.ab.ca (joe tham) subject: where can i find sipp? organization: edmonton remote systems #2, edmonton, ab, canada lines: 11 i recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines called sipp (simple polygon processor). could anyone tell me where i can ftp the source code and which is the newest version around? also, i've never used renderman so i was wondering if renderman is like sipp? ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make a program that creates the image... thanks, joe tham -- joe tham joth@ersys.edmonton.ab.ca
