from: seth@north13.acpub.duke.edu (seth wandersman) subject: univesa driver reply-to: seth@north13.acpub.duke.edu (seth wandersman) lines: 7 nntp-posting-host: north13.acpub.duke.edu i got the univesa driver available over the net. i thought that finally my 1-meg oak board would be able to show 680x1024 256 colors. unfortunately a program still says that i can't do this. is it the fault of the program (fractint) or is there something wrong with my card. univesa- a free driver available over the net that makes many boards vesa compatible.
