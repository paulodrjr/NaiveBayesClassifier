from: diablo.uucp!cboesel (charles boesel) subject: why does illustrator autotrace so poorly? organization: diablo creative reply-to: diablo.uucp!cboesel (charles boesel) x-mailer: uaccess lite - macintosh release: 1.6v2 lines: 12 i've been trying to figure out a way to get adobe illustrator to auto-trace >exactly< what i see on my screen. but it misses the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images that are useless - i need exact tracing, not approximate. i've tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace tolerances but it doesn't help. any suggestions? -- charles boesel @ diablo creative | if pro = for and con = against cboesel@diablo.uu.holonet.net | then what's the opposite of progress? +1.510.980.1958(pager) | what else, congress.
