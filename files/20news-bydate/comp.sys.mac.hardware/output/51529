from: hulthage@morue.usc.edu (ingemar hulthage) subject: dead mouse ? organization: university of southern california, los angeles, ca lines: 11 distribution: usa nntp-posting-host: morue.usc.edu my macclassic mouse died. i dissected it and determined that it is the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed mode. this tragedy prompts the following questions: 1. is it easy to find a microswitch that i could solder into the place of the old switch ? 2. i have old mice (max+, mac 512ke), can they be used with some adapter ?
