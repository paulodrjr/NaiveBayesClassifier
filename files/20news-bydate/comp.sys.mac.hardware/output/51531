from: ado@quince.bbn.com (buz owen) subject: performa 450 internal modem? lines: 10 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: quince.bbn.com i hear that the performa 450 is really an lciii with an internal modem. can the modem part be obtained and installed in an lciii? it would be nice if it were actually a powerbook internal modem, but that might be too much to hope for.
