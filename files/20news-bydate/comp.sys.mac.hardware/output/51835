from: wcaw@juliet.caltech.edu (wilisch, wolf c. a.) subject: imagewriter ii at 50 hz organization: california institute of technology lines: 12 distribution: world nntp-posting-host: juliet.caltech.edu news-software: vax/vms vnews 1.41 hi! a while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the iwii in europe (in countries with 50 hz ac current). the consensus at the time was that the iwii would not work there. as i will be moving there this summer, i called apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the iwii (as bought in the u.s.) will definitely run on 50 hz ac current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 v current is used). the same info, turns out, can be found in the iwii manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but i didn't really trust that. does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary? just wondering. chris w.
