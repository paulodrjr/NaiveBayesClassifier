from: da228@cleveland.freenet.edu (charles g. williams) subject: has anyone had problems with ibm drives in their machines? organization: case western reserve university, cleveland, oh (usa) lines: 24 reply-to: da228@cleveland.freenet.edu (charles g. williams) nntp-posting-host: hela.ins.cwru.edu hi, the subject line says it all. my system acts weird at times. all of a sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc. this was a really big problem for a while. i couldn't even format my drive properly. i installed hdt's driver and things got better. now all i have to do is reinstall the system. could an incompatibility exist between it and a quantum external drive. i'm looking for a pure hardware solution. it's not a virus, bad software, etc. could i have a bad scsi cable? or is the ibm (wds-80) just a screwey drive? thanks, chuck -- chuck williams ==> cs intern ==> pacific northwest laboratories da228@cleveland.freenet.edu cg_williams@ccmail.pnl.gov
