from: guykuo@carson.u.washington.edu (guy kuo) subject: re: iisi clock upgrades organization: university of washington lines: 8 nntp-posting-host: carson.u.washington.edu i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different speeds. there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. a quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive.
