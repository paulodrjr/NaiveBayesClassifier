(sys 7.1 compat.) nntp-posting-host: lk-hp-20.hut.fi reply-to: jartsu@vipunen.hut.fi organization: helsinki university of technology, finland lines: 14 hi there! what is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for non-apple drives? i would mainly need it for a syquest removable media drive, but maybe for some normal drives too. i have heard and seen good things about silverlining, but don't know any competitors. it does not need to be fancy, filled with features... i more like it affordable. thanks -- jartsu
