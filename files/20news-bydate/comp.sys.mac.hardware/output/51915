from: ferch@ucs.ubc.ca (les ferch) subject: re: when is apple going to ship cd300i's? organization: the university of british columbia lines: 5 nntp-posting-host: swiss.ucs.ubc.ca note that if you get the external cd300 for your centris or q800 you will miss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire from the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the cd. connecting to the sound input port on the back of the computer won't do unless you can live with mono.
