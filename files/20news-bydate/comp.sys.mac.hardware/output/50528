from: jmilhoan@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (jt) subject: 2 powerbook questions article-i.d.: magnus.1993apr6.215646.23800 organization: the ohio state university lines: 13 nntp-posting-host: bottom.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu 1. why, or how actually, can a powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the 72 dpi resolution? (i assume that it doesn't, and i don't mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions) 2. any info on price drops or new models (non-duo) coming up? thanks, jt
