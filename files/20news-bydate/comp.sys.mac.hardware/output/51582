from: rogoschp@max.cc.uregina.ca (are we having fun yet ???) subject: vga monitors and the mac lc series of computers organization: university of regina lines: 9 i recall reading that the mac lc (and presumably the lc ii & iii) can use stand ard vga monitors, with appropriate cable adapters. i am uncertain of this sinc e i have asked other people who say this is not so. so can all vga monitors be used on the mac lc? what are the specs needed for a pc monitor to work with a mac lc (horizontal nad vertical frequencies)?
