from: viralbus@daimi.aau.dk (thomas martin widmann) subject: position of 'b' on erg. keyboard organization: daimi: computer science department, aarhus university, denmark lines: 12 so far i have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard, but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split. however, when i learned typing in school some years ago, i was taught to write 'b' with my right hand. is this a difference between danish and american typing, or what??? thanks a lot in advance! -- thomas widmann -lernu esperanton- viralbus@daimi.aau.dk solidvm petit in lingvis
