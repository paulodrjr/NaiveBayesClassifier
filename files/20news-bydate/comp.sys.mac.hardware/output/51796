from: simsh@aix02.ecs.rpi.edu (hillel y. sims) subject: what size vram simm is this? nntp-posting-host: aix02.ecs.rpi.edu lines: 20 hi everyone. i recently posted about how i received a bad vram chip for my new lciii, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512k lc vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. so i'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so i can figure out what type of chip macconnection sent me. each chip says: m518121a-80j 2515251 on the back of the card, it says 0593 i believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but i can't figure out what the size is supposed to be. if anyone can help, i'd be grateful. please email me your response. thanks a lot! -- hillel sims ----- simsh@rpi.edu ----- rensselaer polytechnic institute "is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?" --anonymous
