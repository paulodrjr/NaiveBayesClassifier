from: jenski@cae.wisc.edu (anders jenski) subject: quadra 950/900 case source wanted organization: u of wisconsin-madison college of engineering lines: 12 hello all, if anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and motherboard of a quadra 950 please let me know. i have tried some mail order places and some local stores. both groups would prefer that i part with over $1000 to get just the case. in my eyes this seems about $600-$700 to much. any comments? i currently own the guts of a 950. please email me or post to this group w/ info, thanks in advance, andy
