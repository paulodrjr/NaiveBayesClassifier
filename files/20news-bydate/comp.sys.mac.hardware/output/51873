from: gt8798a@prism.gatech.edu (anthony s. kim) subject: syquest 150 ??? distribution: usa organization: georgia institute of technology lines: 3 i remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest. has anyone else heard anything about this? i'd be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 150.
