(ought to see if att has a spec sheet) skipjack sounds like a normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless they want to wait for isdn (that we should be so lucky...). feeding pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream before it hits the modem. unless you want to pay for two fast modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between your phone and the wall. >- carl pgp 2 key by finger or e-mail eli ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu
