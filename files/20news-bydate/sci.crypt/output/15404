from: aj@sage.cc.purdue.edu (john dormer) subject: re: text of white house announcement and q&as on clipper chip encryption summary: misinterretation got us here today keywords: constitution, misinterpretation, law organization: purdue daemons distribution: na lines: 26 misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what united states lawyers use to make their bread and butter. in manchester, ct a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a game system galled "lasergames," similar in many aspects to photon (tm). three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. among these things was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the opposition to lasergames wanted to harp upon. the judge took the two words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that lasergames could not operate in manchester. keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries, and not light beams. clearly from context, lasergames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial of operating permission was justified. if i had the text of the law i'd post it, but i'm afraid i don't remember it all well enough to even try. that little bit with the two words stuck well, though. : john dormer : jad@expert.cc.purdue.edu
