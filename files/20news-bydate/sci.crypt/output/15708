from: pom@anke.imsd.uni-mainz.de (prof. dr. klaus pommerening) subject: des: init vector as additional key? keywords: des, cbc, cfb, key search nntp-posting-host: anke.imsd.uni-mainz.de organization: johannes gutenberg universitaet mainz lines: 15 the recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack against des is quite feasible now. but normally des is applied in cbc or cfb mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. questions: - makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? then we have a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key. - if yes: is anything known about the security of this key scheme? can we break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space? -- klaus pommerening institut fuer medizinische statistik und dokumentation der johannes-gutenberg-universitaet obere zahlbacher strasse 69, w-6500 mainz, germany
