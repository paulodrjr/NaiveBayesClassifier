(this is the main >concern of most of us, i think. the camel's nose in the tent, etc.) excuse me? this has *already* happened. there's a couple of humps in the tent already. ask the folks at qualcomm what became of the non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their cdma digitial cellular phone standard? there *already* are restrictions in place. you have it slightly wrong. they dumped the encryption system because they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for u.s. use. there are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong cryptography -- yet. -- perry metzger pmetzger@shearson.com -- laissez faire, laissez passer. le monde va de lui meme.
