introduction atheism
this article attempts provide general introduction whilst
have tried neutral possible regarding contentious you
should always remember that this document represents only one
would encourage you read widely and draw your own some
relevant books are listed companion
provide sense cohesion and have presented this article
imaginary conversation between atheist and all the
questions asked the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
repeatedly since the newsgroup was some other
frequently asked questions are answered companion
please note that this article arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from christian this because the faq files reflect
questions which have actually been and predominantly christians
who proselytize
when talk talking primarily about religions such
judaism and which involve some sort superhuman divine
much the discussion will apply other but some
may
atheism characterized absence belief the existence
some atheists and believe that god does not the former
often referred the and the latter
important note the difference between these two
simple disbelief the existence
positive belief that god does not please not
fall into the trap assuming that all atheists are
some atheists believe the all others limit their
atheism specific such the christian rather than making
disbelieving god the same thing believing
definitely disbelief proposition means that one does not believe
not believing that something true not equivalent
believing that one may simply have idea whether true
which brings
agnosticism
the term was coined professor huxley meeting the
metaphysical society defined agnostic someone who
disclaimed atheism and believed that the ultimate origin things
must some cause unknown and
thus agnostic someone who believes that not and cannot know for
sure whether god
words are slippery and language beware assuming that
you can work out philosophical point view simply from the fact
that she calls herself atheist for many people
use agnosticism mean and use the word only when
referring
beware also that because the word has many shades
very difficult generalize about about all you can say for
sure that atheists believe for certainly
the case that all atheists believe that science the best way find out
about the
what the philosophical justification basis for
there are many philosophical justifications for find out why
particular person chooses best ask
many atheists feel that the idea god presented the major religions
essentially and that logically impossible that
such god could others are atheists through because they
see evidence that god
impossible prove the
there are many such for
quite simple prove that there does not exist prime number larger than
all other prime this deals with objects
obeying whether gods universes are similarly
matter for
assuming for the moment that the existence god not provably
there are still subtle reasons for assuming the
assume that something does not always possible
show that this assumption invalid finding single
the other hand assume that something does and the thing
question not provably showing that the assumption invalid
may require exhaustive search all possible places where such thing
might show that such exhaustive search
often impractical there such problem with largest
because can prove that they
therefore generally accepted that must assume things not exist
unless have evidence that they even theists follow this rule most
the they believe even though they conclusively
prove that unicorns exist
assume that god exists make assumption which probably cannot
cannot make exhaustive search everywhere god might
prove that exist the sceptical atheist assumes
default that god does not since that assumption can
those who profess strong atheism usually not claim that sort god
they generally restrict their claims cover
varieties god described followers various whilst
may impossible prove conclusively that god may
possible prove that god described particular religious
book does not may even possible prove that god described
any religion
believing that god described any religion exists very
close believing that god sufficiently different
that based the impossibility disproving every kind
god are not really
what god essentially
god interacts with our universe any the effects his interaction
must hence his interaction with our universe must
god essentially must therefore the case that
does not interact with our universe any many atheists would argue
that god does not interact with our universe
importance whether exists
the bible god was easily detectable the
surely should still detectable
note that not demanding that god interact scientifically
physical must surely possible perceive some
effect caused his how can distinguish him
from all the other things that
you may think philosophical justification for but
still religious
one the most common pastimes philosophical discussion
redefinition the cynical view this game
person begins making contentious when person points out
that person gradually the words used the
statement until arrives something person prepared
then records the along with the fact that person has agreed
and eventually uses the statement but
uses his original definitions all the words rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed get agree rather than seen
apparently will tend play
the point this digression that the answer the question
atheism religious depends crucially upon what meant
generally characterized belief superhuman
controlling power especially some sort god and faith and
worth pointing out passing that some varieties buddhism are not
according such
atheism certainly not belief any sort superhuman nor
categorized worship any meaningful widening the definition
encompass atheism tends result many other aspects
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed well such
and watching
not but surely belief atheism
still just act like religion
not entirely clear that sceptical atheism something one
actually believes
necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions
make some sort sense out the sensory data most atheists
try adopt few core beliefs and even those are subject
questioning experience throws them into
science has number core for generally
assumed that the laws physics are the same for all these are
the sort core assumptions atheists such basic ideas are called
then almost everything know must said based
acts and the term loses its
faith more often used refer certain belief
according such atheism and science are certainly not acts
individual atheists scientists can dogmatic
religious followers when claiming that something this not
general there are many atheists who would reluctant
state with certainty that the universe
faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence
sceptical atheism certainly fit that sceptical atheism
has strong atheism but still really
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend refer experimental data
the lack when asserting that god does not
atheism not surely
unfortunate human tendency label everyone either
the truth not
atheism the position that runs logically counter that
can said when religious believers
speak atheists being they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort antipathy hatred towards
this categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite
atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad
most atheists take and let unless they
will not usually mention their except perhaps close
this may part because atheism not
many
few atheists are quite and may even try others
when such atheists have made little
impact society outside the eastern bloc
digress the soviet union was originally dedicated separation
church and just like the soviet citizens were legally free
worship they the institution came about when
stalin took control the soviet union and tried destroy the churches
order gain complete power over the
some atheists are quite vocal about their but only where they see
religion encroaching matters which are not its business for
the government the such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain
you allow religion have say the running the
surely the same state
the principle the separation church and state that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters religious
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion the expense
but also that cannot promote any belief which religious
religions can still have say discussion purely secular for
religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political even many organizations
campaigning for increase spending foreign aid are founded
religious long they campaign concerning secular
and long they not discriminate religious most atheists
are quite happy see them have their
about prayer why you care people
because people who pray are voters and and tend things
that those who pray just christian prayer
schools intimidating even they are told that they
need not join the diversity religious and belief means
that impossible formulate meaningful prayer that will
acceptable all those present any public
tend have friends and family who reasonable
care about friends and family wasting their even without other
mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign what about
why there any atheist charities
atheists object the religious
there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute some atheists contribute religious charities for
the sake the practical good they some atheists even voluntary work
for charities founded theistic
most atheists seem feel that atheism worth shouting about
connection with atheism just obvious everyday
and many feel that somewhat not say
use simple charity excuse plug particular set
religious
building hospital say not believe
rather strange rather like holding party say not
why the atheism rarely
said atheism but perhaps backlash against
way
perhaps for but many people have parents who not attempt
force any religious ideas upon and many those people
choose call themselves
also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion
backlash against atheist way being the
other many people choose religion way conforming the
expectations
the conclude much about whether atheism religion are
backlash although people have tendency
along with group rather than act think
atheists differ from religious
they believe all there
atheists may listen heavy metal even they may prefer
verdi even they know the they may wear hawaiian
they may dress all they may even wear orange
buddhists lack belief any sort some atheists even carry copy
the bible around for arguing
whoever you the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising atheists are usually unexceptional behaviour and
but atheists less moral than religious
that you define morality obedience then course
atheists are less moral they obey any but usually when one
talks one talks what acceptable and unacceptable
behaviour within
humans are social and maximally successful they must
with each this good enough reason discourage most
atheists from purely for the purposes
many atheists behave way simply because they
feel natural tendency empathize with other why they care
what happens they they simply are that
there are some people who behave and try use
atheism justify their there are equally many people who
behave and then try use religious beliefs justify their
for
trustworthy saying that deserves full jesus christ
came into the world save but for that very was
shown mercy that jesus christ might display his unlimited
patience example for those who would believe him and receive
eternal now the king the only
honor and glory forever and
the above quote from statement made the court february
jeffrey the notorious cannibal serial killer
seems that for every atheist there
religious but what more trivial
survey conducted the roper organization found that behavior
deteriorated after while only respondents
said they had driven intoxicated before being had done
after had used illegal drugs before
two percent admitted engaging illicit sex
before
september
seems that religion does not have monopoly moral
there such thing atheist
you mean there such thing morality for then the
answer explained many atheists have ideas about morality
which are least strong those held religious
you mean atheism have characteristic moral then the answer
atheism itself does not imply anything much about how person
will most atheists follow many the same
but for different atheists view morality something created
according the way humans feel the world rather
than seeing set rules decreed supernatural
atheists just theists who are denying
study the freedom from religion foundation found that over the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around
atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance they are
unbelievers through the vast majority them have spent time
studying one more sometimes very great they have
made careful and considered decision reject religious
this decision inevitable consequence that
for naturally sceptical the choice
atheism often the only one that makes and hence the only
choice that person can honestly
atheists want believe
atheists live their lives though there nobody watching over many
them have desire watched matter how the
figure might
some atheists would like able believe god but should
one believe things merely because one wants them the risks
such approach should atheists often decide that wanting
believe something not there must evidence for the
course atheists see evidence for the existence god they are
unwilling their souls
not most atheists were previously has been explained
the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god
many atheists have spent time prayer trying reach
true that some atheists lack open but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere offensive and
comments such course god you just looking
are likely viewed
you wish engage philosophical debate with atheists
vital that you give them the benefit the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere they say that they have searched for you are not
willing believe that they are basically telling the debate
the whole life completely pointless
many atheists live purposeful they decide what they think gives
meaning and they pursue those they try make their lives
not wishing for eternal but having influence other
people who will live for atheist may dedicate his life
political the hope leaving his mark
natural human tendency look for random
means obvious that the sort thing
that has
put another not everything which looks like question actually
sensible thing some atheists believe that asking the
meaning silly asking the meaning cup
they believe that life has purpose just
how atheists find comfort time
there are many ways obtaining from even
less spiritual from food drink
that may sound rather empty and vulnerable way face but
should individuals believe things because they are
should they face reality matter how harsh might
the decision for the individual most atheists are
unable believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
makes them feel they put truth before and consider
that searching for truth sometimes makes them feel just
hard
atheists worry that they might suddenly shown
the short answer
many atheists have been atheists for they have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence but they have
found all invalid
thousands years religious belief resulted any good proof
the existence atheists therefore tend feel that they are unlikely
proved wrong the immediate and they stop worrying about
why should theists question their the same arguments
because the beliefs being questioned are not weak atheism
the sceptical asserts strong atheism
negative theism very strong positive
atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because the very real harm they can cause not just the
but everyone
sort
religion represents huge financial and work burden not
just matter religious believers wasting their money church
think all the time and effort spent building and
imagine how that effort could better
many theists believe miracle there have been plenty instances
ill people being ceasing take the medicines
prescribed them and dying some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions religious
arguable that the catholic opposition birth control and
condoms particular increasing the problem overpopulation many
countries and contributing the spread aids
religious believers have been known murder their children rather than
allow their children become atheists marry someone different
real they just claimed believers some
sort
what makes real there are many one true religions hard
look there are many competing all
convinced that they are the only true sometimes they even fight
and kill each how atheist supposed decide real
christian and who when even the major christian churches like the
catholic church and the church england decide amongst
the most atheists take pragmatic and decide that anyone who
calls himself and uses christian belief dogma justify his
should considered maybe some those christians
are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely
the bible can readily used support acts
much moral the bible the word why have
made less easy and how you know that your beliefs
perversion what your god
there single unambiguous interpretation the then why
should atheist take one interpretation over another just your
but someone claims that believes jesus and that murdered
others because jesus and the bible told him must call him
those extreme sorts beliefs should but since
nobody has ever proved that god does not must very unlikely
that more basic religious shared all are
that does not because was pointed out the start this
positive assertions concerning the existence entities are inherently much
harder disprove than negative nobody has ever proved that unicorns
but that make unlikely that they are
therefore much more valid hold negative assertion default than
hold positive assertion atheists
would argue that asserting nothing better
why are there many
the popularity belief has little with how
whether consider how many people believe
and other
many atheists feel that simply human weakness want believe
certainly many primitive human religion allows the
people deal with phenomena that they not adequately
more religion than the industrialized
find people believing religious explanations phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural religion may have started
means attempting explain the but nowadays serves other
purposes
many cultures have developed surely that must say
not most religions are only superficially for
worth remembering that religions such buddhism and taoism lack any sort
concept god the christian
most religions are quick denounce competing
rather odd use one religion try and justify
about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
that god
for every scientist philosopher who believes there one who
does has already been pointed the truth belief
not determined how many people believe important
realize that atheists not view famous scientists philosophers the
same way that theists view their religious
famous scientist only she may expert some but
when she talks about other matters her words carry special many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish speaking
subjects which lie outside their fields
are you really saying that widespread belief religion indicates
not certainly indicates that the religion question has
properties which have helped spread
the theory memetics talks sets ideas which can propagate
themselves between human analogy with some atheists view
religions sets particularly successful parasitic which spread
encouraging their hosts convert some memes avoid destruction
discouraging believers from questioning using peer pressure
keep believers from admitting that they were some
religious memes even encourage their hosts destroy hosts controlled
other
the memetic view there particular virtue associated with
successful propagation religion not good thing because
the number people who believe any more than disease good thing
because the number people who have caught
religion not entirely least puts across important
what are the fundamental messages
there are many important ideas atheists the following are just
few surprised see ideas which are also present some
there more moral behaviour than mindlessly following
especially sceptical positive
you want your life have some sort you
find
search for what even makes you
make the most your probably the only one
good relying some external power change you must change
just because popular mean
you must assume assume something easy
believe things just because you want them
and finally most
all beliefs should open

some evidence that must have known and that the content
was known but not
new argument could you elaborate
the argument goes quotes appear but not
the almost codified way they were matthew they are
considered similar enough point knowledge and
not entirely different
that knew luke would obviously put him after and would
evidence for the latter
think this you take the most traditional
luke might have known but john elder figure either
talking spans time here which are well within the range
are talking date texts not the age the the usual
explanation for the time order matthew and luke does not consider
their respective says matthew has read the text and luke
that matthew probably that
assumed that john knew the content the evidence
for that not
earlier manuscripts john have been
where and how are they how old are
got the info was the late
early and was possibly old
when they are from about why they shed doubt the order
putting john after the rest the
see your exactly what james felder they had
hand knowledge the and obvious that least two them
older texts the base their and even the association
paul mark peter are not generally
genuine letter peter would close
original together with card sender and receiver would
that supposed missing
think step source that luke and mark
matthew learned their stories directly from then really
believe the sort transformation from jesus that
people news one generally gets better
than
john then nothing more
that john was disciple not generally the style and language
together with the theology are usually used
the argument that john was disciple relies the claim the gospel
john there any other evidence for
one step and one generation removed bad even our compare that
reports similar events our century almost illiterate
not even speak off that believers are not necessarily the best
also obvious that mark has been how old are the oldest
knowledge can the oldest
after any these and not even
only clear problem the and basically
the oldest versions give strong sense
the point where the shortest versions seem break off
most obvious solution that some point part the text was
material from verse pretty clearly later and seems represent
synopsys the end
other one does not know what the original mark did look like

but how that connected redating

ibm saw mill river box yorktown
	you say lucifer was created with perfect
define perfect
think you
are playing the usual game make sweeping statements like
and note that they mean exactly what they
and that says that you must not use this terms when leads
not trying play games but understand how might seem
way especially when one coming from completely different point
view such
take your foot out your wondered about that already when
was catholic the fact that the contradiction unresolvable
one the reasons why
believe believed similar sentences for long but that shows
the power religion and not anything about its
god could have prevented fall taking away his ability
choose between moral alternatives god worship
that would mean that god was error have make lucifer any
with free will the first
god allows evil there ever was
best but from point
not premise which necessary that
evil allow evil
follows from definition evil ordinarily letting evil
happen allowing evil take this place even causing
another
but could you give definition free especially the
presence omniscient
other god created conscious
who have the ability choose between moral choices independently
all
the omniscient attribute god will know what the creatures will even
before the omnipotent has created there choice all
the course events
not even for the omniscient extend argument james
god then
creating beings with free moral choice greater good than
emergence ungodliness since created them knowing
outcome
why the greater good allow evil with the knowledge that
will why not make unipolar system with the possibility
doing good not doing but that does not necessarily imply
doing logically but your god has not done
not know that such logically god restrains
choice choose evil and simply
can said that the being truly has free moral
defined loving and obeying and avoiding
behaviors which god then how can you say that one
not evil like not sure
doing without doing evil logically
and when not how can have free you have said
something about choices and the scenario gives therefore have
what you define free
imagine the can good other but cannot harm
easily implemented making everyone appreciate being the object good
but make them long for they can not feel the absence
good
but whose case the omnipotent can
would not you want logically consistent you
have give the pet idea omnipotent
were just speculating about the
pink then there would basis for such
but this idea god just fall out the
while reading science fiction know that
will the bible describes god who
nevertheless created beings with free moral from which
definitional logic but not all there
seems least certain amount evidence
indicates that god exists and that the biblical description
him may fair that evidence which bolsters the
that the bible describes omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
the credibility the nothing
and lot people would interested evidence for
there any with these

that there some out there
form our morals achieve
for the goal morality the survival and
propogation the another example moral system
presented within the declaration which states that

have moral must define the purpose the that

certainly violation the golden thought had
murder intentional killing against his
you responded this asking whether not the execution
person under our system capital punishment was murder
fail see what this has with never claimed that our
morality was objective
thought that was your very first that there was
kind and that example that was
murder you want claim that any
murder violates the golen which certainly pillar most
every moral not assuming that our current system
and the manner its implementation are objectively think that
very good but

involved fatal but the likelihood surprisingly
just because you are the man the firing squad whose gun shooting
blanks does not mean that you are less

thank why you just say that all killing this
basically what you are
getting bit tired your probabilistic
are you attempting
the system usually works pretty well small consolation
poor innocent bastard getting the lethal your
value human life based solely statistical
sound like unswerving adherent the needs the many
the needs the fuck the
most people have found the risk you are probably
much more likely die plane even using electric
than you are executed personally think
that the risk but ideal moral such risk
the fudge factor necessary such
approximation the
keith
	think that about people approve the
even realizing all its this make
are the sole judge
from what merits you find capital
are talking about the majority the people that support
think that why most people are
favor the murderer going people
that think that should what most people
think would fair for the murderer while his victim
petty and
perhaps you think that petty and but your views are the
have local televised hot topic talk show that very recently
segment capital each and every advocate
use this portion our system cited the
reason for supporting bastard deserved true
and
where are required have and
someone wrongs will take great lengths make sure that his advantage
similar situation forced upon someone kills
then can apply the golden rule and kill this person
not our entire moral system based such
are you stating that human life and that should
never this would sound like some sort religious
how reasonable when you think about
the person could released found but you still
undo the imiprisonment that was perhaps
people could watch them closely the cost would
especially just implanted some sort
you rather alive prison dead the
once criminal has committed his desires are
you still have not answered you are concerned about
the death penalty due the possibility the execution
then why this same concern shared with
your administer minimum punishment avoid
violating the liberty happiness innocent
keith
	kill this person innocent person convicted
murder would but would not the
considered with being
fudge factor necessary account for the inability
objective due lack absolutely true
society collective decides carry the burden executing
then also carries the blame for their innocent
each and every voter who casts ballot favor
punishment part guilty the murder each and
innocent victim the
why are only those people favor the system society
accepts such then each member society blame when
innocent person gets those that are not favor should
work convince
most members our society have accepted the considered
the risk every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic this something that surely
going happen when many people are all question
what risk much more likely that innocent person
will killed driving than that one will
keith
	maintaining classes and even seems
more innocent people higher risk unjust death than
would the state executed classes and with occasional
answer from the position that would indeed place these people
prison for
that depends not only their predisposition towards but
also their success rate escape and therefore their ability
commit the same crimes
other lifetime imprisonment perhaps
not because not executing these but because
not being careful enough about how lock them
they said that queens could they blew the bronx
and sank manhattan out
	propose
these two trends greater level general depression society
other psychological and greater sexual promiscuity are
with the latter being prime cause the cannot
any evidence beyond this this but the whole thesis
very reasonable and request that people ponder upon
damn right you provide any evidence for
rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible such
simple they psychology would hard science
with roughly the same mathematical soundness
your premise may well much more
that reflects your socialization and religious
well your need validate your religious were
pretend have all the answers would say that the
and intolerance brought about adherence
fundamentalist religions play just large role depressing
the members our
your mileage obviously
they said that queens could they blew the bronx
and sank manhattan out
	would say that one innocent person killed some sense
bad certainly feel that way when punish
for single
reform system reducing the number deaths
produce system say should not back
system even though doing would only
single extra
seems think that one bad many sense somewhat stronger than
one you
argument that the sole purpose the death penalty
kill that primary would argue
continue kill people practice that has
almost especially when you know you will killing
the very the existence the prison system and our
transportation system are based their merits not
their are willing accept few lost innocent
lives because there overwhelming benefit the continued
existence these one has stretch the evidence and
the arguments make the same claim for capital
just case clear maintain capital
punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides with
net positive
were you pin corner and would have respond
that belief the state should have the right take life
but open that seems others are
tiring this thread

halat
	this god truly omnipotent you folks like then why
terminate
the same reason flibble glop ork
thing you are demanding that must able has meaning its
this classic example excessive faith the fact that
have trouble talking about something imply that
simply implies that hard talk there very good chance
that god flibble glop ork charlie wingate can flibble glop
ork and even
	though might fun debate capital punishment
probably the wrong group for the only relevance here
that you seem able tell what capital punishment
and when that when you tell murder
you are using term you have not yet
said that when innocent person has been this
objectively who blame another
seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts
realizing the
innocent person shooting random into the and
killing innocent person when the
administers system capital when you
you know that they actions you are taking will sooner
result the killing innocent
but there also probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest society because
driving will kill will but people continue
and flying are not punishments inflicted unwilling
they are risks that take upon ourselves
and argue that our law system similar perhaps innocent
person will punished but work prevent
many criminals free result our trying prevent punishment
our own driving kills someone then there moral
know least one person who was involved fatal
and they felt vey guilty
such accidents are totally given the numner vehicals
the the blame
this what you you were saying that there were such
false witness that resulted innocent person being convicted and killed
would still the fault the since did the actual
just commented that the state does the does not
there being false how could the state
the killing even the case sincere mistakes
but the state not fault such the state can only
much prevent false
what are you trying that capital punishment
always murder because the possibilty human error invalidating
saying capital punishment not because
that and the but because involves taking human
definition make appeals dictionaries
this what you call the question whether not
all such are are you saying that all taking human life
matter what the
decide murder then should say
and lists our reasons for doing and live with the moral
should not play word games and pretend that
and opinion about how society
this basically how society accepts the risk that
innocent person will murdered every member
society shares this most definitions murder
include some sort malicious which not involved
were trying discuss objective moral least its
what ramifications does your personal system have
were not discussing objective moral was showing
that you have for one you were incapable
defining the terms for
murder violates the golden executions because allowing
society implicitly accepts the consequences matter who the
innocent victim
not talking about reading are just talking about knowing the
can never absolutely certain that have the but
court systems work principle knowing the
but you simply are not quoting yourself here
what you
since are looking totally objectively this
know what people are thinking when they are voting
the person the intent malicious and
then the execution would
you are doing now slide into another which
the jury being beyond serious
not the same knowing what their minds beyond
serious
reading the minds the jury would certainly tell whether not conviction
was moral objective only the absolute truth
and the jury system one method approximate such that
twelve members must convinced
jury which comes from sufficiently prejudiced background
allow itself persuaded beyond serious doubt evidence
you and would laugh
but read the minds these would know that the
conviction was
would perfectly fair could read assume that
would fair knew the absolute why much less
your only have good approximation the absolute
not question your which have quoted
claim about whether can was
able distinguish capital punishnment from
while could objectively determine the difference knew all
possible always determine the difference our
flawed think that our system almost good
but still objectively you matter
fair either fair
huge can read can
cannot read can know the difference
not degree but what can
but what know has effect objective
think possible produce fairly objective are
which goals supposed
not going waste time trying devise system that
sure does not
why are you
simply want people confront
why reality
this the reality can
even after the about the fairness the justice
for every innocent person released from death there
have been dozen innocent people
simply
can assume that the system fairly least most
you realize that the correctness our system says nothing about
totally ideal and objective
what are going the one can pretend
have and that can know things can
and the justie system and that can wave
wand and make certain types killing not and
our
can have ideal but the working system can not
can only hope create system that close approximation
the ideal system
the other can recognize that all justice has small
hope probability punishing the and that the
bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic
the systems set and then here
murdering maybe some will even say
all this strictly
all bear the most people seem willing
think that the second preferable that requires people
face the moral consequences what instead
sheltering ourselves from them magic ceremonies and word
must realize the consequences all our why you keep
separating the justice system from the
lest also think have objective moral
and believe only have take that idea seriously
someone presents evidence
think our country has objective but think such
objective system can without objective
system not possible

	what ken said
there have previously been people like you your

sure sounds like ken accusing the guy being
previous posting
this perfectly fine and agree with
but what does have with the issue hand here
whether not ken accused the fellow from germany being
grant that did not explicity make this but
came pretty damn certainly accusing the guy
sympathizing with those who would like exterminate the and
good enough for
the poster casually trashed two thousand years jewish and
ken replied that there had previously been people like him
there have there have also been people who
were formally but the nazi party would have gone nowhere
without the active and tacit support the ordinary man the

now what exactly you understand about what and why
you see what has with the matter
	germany was hardly the only country discriminate against the
although has the worst reputation because did the best job
expressing general european dislike this should not turn
into debate but you should also point out that
antisemitism was based religious while was racial
and aesthetic just blanketing the whole

find these intriguing could you give bit
more explanation for which religion
and which
	british around blowing skyscrapers
know you are doing but seems you are implying
that the person accused blowing the wtc actually did
and
that islamic teachings have something with blowing the
was replying person who attempted justify the fatwa
against rushdie the grounds that his work was intentionally
think that take single sentence from fairly long
and say
know you are doing but
seems you are
the very best quite and perhaps even
anyone care dig back and read the full
they will see nothing the
trust you deny that islamic teaching has
with the fatwa against
	understand the point this petty basic
principle islam that one born muslim one says testify
that there god but god and mohammad prophet
long one does not explicitly reject islam word then one
considered muslim all the phenomenon attempting
make into general rule psychology direct odds with basic
islamic you want attack islam you could better than
than argue against something that islam explicitly
then mozumder incorrect when says that when committing
bad people temporarily become
	saddam believed would pray five times
the other actually committed genocide the name
lenin and stalin have said these two were die
atheist and believed atheism integral part
stalin killed millions the name atheism was
characteristic the version nothing
another characteristic socialism was the centralization
food would you therefore say that stalin and lenin killed
millions the name rationing course
horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything
earlier posts you stated that true believers were incapable
suppose you believe you could reason that one has ever
been killed the name what perfect world you live
the reasons that you are atheist that you limit god giving
god does not have

the bible really inspired god and really that
then would make damn certain all the translators and
and people interpreting and copying were getting
then why should put any merit all something
has been corrupted over and over and over man even was
inspired
over and theory pretty comparison the
hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text
fact changed very little over space some two this
all that people who believe text this manner
likely makes some pains make good
you honestly hold that tripe for start there are enough
current versions the bible make comparisons show that what you write
above utter witness and greek
orthodox but really convince you have take you good

best gross oversimplification the factors people
reckon television and the increase you
think its the increase others thinks its because
psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
criminals con them into letting them out into the others think
the increase designer others think communist

pink flying need say
harbor beliefs there good evidence for god
some folks call this does not suffer
think
for many the lack belief gods secondary
epistemological what accept reliable way
there are known valid logical arguments for the existence
nor there any empirical evidence that they most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea god one that
must accepted faith belief without sound logical
basis empirical reliable way
there probably nothing else most people would accept the absence
any possibility even when agree take someone elses
word just mean that having found this person
reliable the judge him likely reliable source
find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere why assume will provide reliable knowledge about
the difference between the atheist and the theist fundamentally then
one whether not faith held reliable way
rather some agnostic posters would have whether ones faith
gods the theist believes that faith acceptable
basis for belief even rejects faith reliable
other for example his work the atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead reliable
agnosticism seems less defensible position than
theism unless one sceptic regards all other

everything then tell what that

what would wrong with their lobbying otherwise attempting
influence
keith
	see understand what you are order talk
about atheists must first have been immersed
religion that only the rare individual could have
you said that think people can discuss
the subjective merits religion this should
people here have said that everyone would better off without
but this almost certainly
are you threatened the the people that use
motto try take away the
guns and axes are both which have been used for
should both taken that think motto misuse
warrants its least not this
keith
	somewhat agree with what comes
different because religion like once
very difficult get out because
experience necessarily have have blind
once have the blind very diffcult for you reason
back atheism
unreasonable ask people try religion order
like asking people dying find out what
well judge death until are dead why should
judge religion without having experienced people have said that
religion bad any and that way
but totally agree with cannot really say
how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed
but some people least seemed helped some ways
can not judge whether religion the right route for
given even for general can say that
not best for personally you can choose not use
hard try find out its you state
keith
	was looking for rigorous definition because otherwise would
the rest our lives arguing what really
think need argue about
you think that the motto points out that this country proud
its freedom and that this something that
from many other
your opinion not shared most
but that because those seeking make government
christianity the dominant religion this country not
they are infringing the rights others who not share
but also many people who are not trying make government recognize
christianity the dominant religion this country think
the motto infringes upon the rights others who not share their
and think that the government already does recognize that
christianity the dominant religion this
you
this say that are supposed believe the teachings
just that most people
said before personally think the motto major
you agree with then what are
most people seem associate christmas with jesus much
see what the problem
you prove your assertion that most people the
christmas with jesus
but hear quite bit about and little anything about
this figure more prominent the holiday were really
associated high degree with are you saying that the
association with jesus personal and that everyone thinks
about but just never talks about
that can prove that most people associate christmas
most importantly with
the point again that there are people who associate
with matter these people are majority
think the numbers takes least
majority those

innocent accident goes asymptotically close just

some are doubt dependent yet see the military paying

while religion certainly has some benefits combat what are

keith
	people would probably think the fanatics propogandized
that this was conflict between the atheists and the
would get the impression that were trying outlaw
contintue try remove all things with religious
not what the people asked perhaps you would right
you said the fundamentalists would think this after they think
are being oppressed when they are not allowed
have not shown where you get this idea that people would
think atheism winner take far can
your groundless prediction that this will
but you taken into the account you
asked germans before wwii the jews shoudl they would
probably answer after the propoganda machine rolled
least some were able tolerate
you only takes small group fanatics whip general
propoganda machines have been gear over number including
and look some the things that have
far they have passed one which currently under
and they have failed outlaw which their
goal that they seem sooo
they managed outlaw abortion due the possible objectivity
the they have managed create quite few problems for
people that wanted have they could create similar problems
for could they can try stop abortions blocking
but imagine what have stop
the margin error very large when you only talk two
than your that your have branched
and the informal survey over half dozen
what have they were you questions
you would claim that questions are biased the minute posted
because the answers agreed with everyone have asked about
possible removal the motto christian has expressed
about its because they like when pointed
them that new motto will not the none have expressed
desire which you have basically
you are able convince them but could you convince
whole room whole
for the atheist portion know some around they have all
disgust with the some noted being harassed christians
used the motto try seem and all would see
glad were gone never supported
think that minor problem that can easily contrasted
with what happen what may
christians designed the does the motto say anything about
why you think that refers
wrote christians think that their religion and
others are why would they other religions
the realm being doubt that any other religions were meant
not clear the religious convictions francis scott key
motto can attributed but least clear that believed
surely there are few christians that think you
but think that most you think that all christians actively
despise other most that have met and
christian
have queried thinks means anything but and only
not ask some people other
but christianity just awfully popular around
you could ask few
have asked and few and all them think
that applicable say that these people
some that know pretty are accurate representations their
always good idea assume that there were dissenting views any
you are assuming that all the views were the and nothing
this
evidence the doubt that there were dissenting
you claim there provide some evidence for your
really like and but really know where
get access from the can anyone help
out
christians
only the sense that neither can probably convinced change their
the motto the money cost you anything
you abolished the all have pay have all the dies and
people paid before get them changed have the motto
now need show that there good reason change everything
doubt that they use
plates for more than this would make easy
remove the motto make next plates without your
that they will have pay extra
some evidence for this
are you saying that they redesign the plates each
your whole argument deleted was that the motto
somehow costs all lot this just not
ones read mention anything about think the issue was
the distinction between religion and
could between religious and not the motto
religious the question whether
only you say doubt provide
evidence for this
that the religion this and the
the that was what most those quotes were and some included
all think that any the quotes
seem have lost mentioned anything all about
they advocated religion over specific religion was not
have missed this said that the motto say anything
anyone that the motto imply anything
particular say that everyone trusts
some form only that the nation the whole
have been through this obvious does not include
much beyond your that the motto refers
more than based the facts that christianity says all
religions are and because seems that the motto was
doubt your
you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should just because they think they are
think the are but advocate their
based this idea doubt that any additional expense would
incurred removing the provide some evidence for your
that
think that any such cost would mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing lot money
being our
the digression the other used for
and other purpose has been found for why should
not
mottos general really have think
should removed because think the benefit would outweighed the
you know what the vote were there other you
that the main reason the motto was required law was bother
you think that this what the majority congress
time had you then show
the opinion the people who put there that
then you should concerned with the opinion the entire
not necessary that the complete majority
the purpose confronting with this
why the majority that put
general public probably does not know about the intent
few people the
daresay more people remember the than the time when key wrote
but they remember the debate surrounding the they remember
that some people intended message against why
you include this your little survey that you were
claim here that scientists would believe doubt
provide evidence for your
should ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity einstein said
good chance that was right least the
for the the
scientists use can need not agree with the court
default because
you need not agree with them all the but you would certainly think
that their decisions would good evidence favor some
but you said you agree with the court because they
attempt make amendment prohibiting flag
realize that something like this external the realm
then how can confident that you know
the you know how the court
can you participate discussion the
judge can speak before and still you ignore the
gag you make your claims
think that would clearly inappropriate for supreme court
justice testify before congress during the consideration
constitutional
order for the court rule case usually must
the analogy
just because something that might find offensive present
mean that rights are being
are talking about something put there
one caused that mushroom unless
things offensive mushroom
some mushrooms can appreciate mushrooms
not the case
the and ignoring the harassment which the
known result the and ignoring that somewhere
the line people were forced put the motto
who was forced put the motto what you

great young and
	other god created conscious
who have the ability choose between moral choices independently
all
the above probably not the most representative but
thought hop
what strikes the fable
fall the seem recall more speculation
than based biblical but rcism may showing
benedikt pointed lucifer had perfect yet
had the free will but where did that choice come
know from genesis that eve was offered opportunity sin
tempter which many assume was but how did lucifer
call the action what you something that god
had not given origin
where the bible there mention free
make big fuss about mankind having free but strikes
being and like
not one that all christians believe
least salvation and free will are very tightly
but then theology was roman
how theologian explain lucifer had
perfect nature how could how could execute
act that contradicted his nature and effect cause evil
exist for the first
	opinion that the strong atheist position requires too much
for comfortable any strong atheists out there
far can strong atheists are far
weak
the cost repudiating the think too much made the
strong weak atheism although the context
where continually attacked the basis that strong atheists
the think the separation
valid
cover what trying say that there
infinitely grey area between weak and well between
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism whereas
can only support the weak atheist effect
strong atheist wish could mathematical
justify strong atheist position believe need only show that
the evidence presented favour any the gods under scrutiny
read the faq argument for the existence god
represented mainstream has ever been
found this adequate evidence that the
undefinable least definition has yet been
found which turn accept sufficient
base disbelief each and every conceivable
little fuzzy the opinions are welcome
perhaps should change the thread
	why would the rushdie case particularly said
elsewhere this actions had effects islamic
countries that not simple say that commit
crime islamic
person has committed crime country was within the borders
the time when was matter the physical
manifestation outside
for hack into ames research lab and delete all their
have committed crime the united the authorities
wish prosecute under law rather than they have automatic
right
this why the net authorities the tried put pressure some sites

	cases prostitution
the man and the prostitute would punished quite
you cannot say lenient and punishes severely
one the exceptions implied all
depends the statistics and who punished some
nothing islamic about allows men rape women
times before blowing the head off public then call
you have given that not end
and chopping off the hands heads people not lenient
rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system
without checking they suit the
and the argument that takes five men rape woman according
islamic
approve think both the prostitute and the customer
the right what they other punishing them
their and punish them severely public just
pointer the hysteria connected with sexuality many
what you
even believe what can you give better answers than
have you got any evidence for your probably opposite
this see why should accept the complex ridden views
oriental
forget that the west historically much without sexual
memory and most will see the connection between the
primitive machism the orient and
people agree having sex and would assume that
would have clue what the detrimental effects supressing
ever heard course probably say that
must evil because allows the disease bla
usually you miss the aids neither spread only through sex
nor necessarily spread having the point very important
the urge for sex stronger than the fear even
stronger than the religious attempts channel forbid the
consequences suppressing sex are worse than the consequences
please note that the idea that everybody would end with aids when sex
not controlled completely

	never concede that their bigotry
other people who determine that examining their

where bigot whomever you say this very
for never having entertain
against your belief simply accuse the person
being
this particular thread vituperation slopped its venom over
into where spend most our time entertaining
arguments against our belief without resorting accusing
others somewhat ironic that our exposure bigotry
happens this instance have originated since
always understood scouting teach tolerance and
understand bigotry irrational prejudice against other people who
happen different ethnic
other inconsequential all the evidence seen
indicates that sexual orientation and lack belief gods are
exactly such inconsequential pending further
conclude that those who show prejudice against such people
are and organizations that exclude such people are
these are for nominal they can
	will argue that your latter believe that gods
rest upon faith that you are making positive statement
gods rather than merely saying
and therefore believe them and not believe then
once not believe god different than saying
believe that god does not still maintain the even
reading the that strong atheism requires
the way usually you are saying here that
driving car requires faith that the car
for and have more faith than have the
premises and the argument
first let say the
might have language problem here regards and
maintain that god does not
exist means have being space and god does not have
god kierkegaard once said that god does not
with this feel rather pointless
debate the called god and that not what
doing believe that god the source and ground
when you say that does not also accept this
but obviously mean two different things
what follows will use the phrase existence
and this the sense that think you are using
would like clarification upon what you mean existence
word the term god used different way
when you use different definition your but until
commonly accepted you would have say the way define god and
that does not existence say does not
there are those who say that one
the indubitable statements
saying god existence either waste existence
already used and there need replace you are implying
more with which case your definition and your argument far
are making
can never prove that god does does not when you say
you believe god does not and that this opinion
upon will have ask observtions are
refering there are observations pro con that
valid here establishing positive
where does that observations based the assumption
that something
and you say there level definition that the assumption
would reject that concept
where your evidence for that meaningful some
benedikt
	this thread has turned into patented
and have any strong try
stick the one thing quite follow about the
seems that there contradiction arguing that the bible
was for its closer what would consider
morally good based our standards and past the one
hand hope this summarizes this argument and the
other
speaking from the jewish
means what many call the old
where the interpretation not necessarily the
but instead the court commentaries
traditions passed down through jewish
this seems the crux you judge the bible according long
line traditions and interpretations coming down the current
rather than its own merits cultural then course
will correspond more closely with more contemporary
how the bible actually being used
that how should judge most people
scissors cut reports
scissors for even though
may have been designed originally cut
possibly good way judge the use the bible teaching
jewish morality but hardly seems fair claim that this
version what was for its
extend the this like saying that the
original were unusually advanced for
their even though they only ever cut and had never even
heard
not arguing that the bible though some the
history depicted modern history
full similar and think the biblical accounts are
worse than their possibly the other
know any reason think the history described the bible
shows abuse than their that complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based particular mythic
interpretations that history but still
think fair take that long tradition interpretation and use
attack condemnation the original
these are for nominal they can
	for surely there the burden guilt solely the

tim pierce madre
	thread was initiated david
his
pretty sure seen biblical rules for when allowable rape
what the codes are about could some more
knowledgable soul than please let know some
asked very narrow and gave very narrow
have got that
david post mention nor did
were the first bring the idea the bible being
most jews believe this any literal
but must have met the minority
and refers any action whereby god
god causes better effects
not intimate with jewish but understand
that you are messianic correct but
appears that the views messianic jews metaphysics
different that the majority while jewish
theology overall quite distinct from the christianic god
have heard that possible for jews attribute
evil their for the bible
still seen effect the interaction some god with
thought agreed that though jews
are set core beliefs that they agree
which that the commandments are accessible
written the language the and another
which that there must legal system update
the context was even when the process adapting
the commandments not the justification the
process lie metaphysic wonder how you break
out the shackles having metaphysics your
you explain this with respect the original commandments
discussed that the commandment that says
feel like raping woman you should instead
and marry what about way this commandment
invalidates
book that commands commit genocide among other
reprehensible the context and
foul invoke some relatively enlightened passages
example for the content the whole
the point that see that there necessary connection
between the theology you use and the interpretation the
very interpretation the bible
long tradition jewish scholars interpreting
theology really enter into
are jewish atheists who interpret the laws
essentially the same way
not the interpretation some but the interpretation
the the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue
with the whole idea that metaphorically and yet allows
you argue with god that that alone
logic proof theology
pose another metaphysical
you
you wrote
have some major spirit with neither absolute power
nor absolute limited means will
communicate with some form spiritual big
you admit that using god this context somewhat
right the assumption that cannot have created the
universe and that the passages the bible referring
that its omnipotence are
what meant the
important question the light what for instance the
passage witrh sodom and gomorrha either there some connection
between the the fact that and your interpretation
purely the question why has
one carry the burden biblical texts when one could simply write
other books that convey the message you might answer that one
becuase some peculiar biblical information might but
that holds true every other and the question remains why has
the bible still special replaced
bargain the dangerous content the bible against some other
message that included
you see the danger doing especially with the metaphers used
the
think the danger doing less than either the
having frozen system having
but there are worse systems does not say anything about
one could not have better
two stories about the importance helping the
one god and the other god has
more helping the resolving
contradiction about the corporeal nature
read two stories the one that god commands people
kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills
children what more important the message that
children are killed has done
and the argument you have given while may not important
the context you have given find out god corporeal
can crucial other religious believers resolve contradictions
with that they choose one the possibilities given arbitrary
and have the advantage being able attribute their decision some
one cannot resolve questions the statement what good when what
good depends the
benedikt
	other there were they would hardly make and
possible explain the phenomenon religion without
the concept and have introduce new assumptions
order show
fully agree with but believe gods
all hinges what you take the word
for believe gods and believe gods
other think that statements like gods are somehow interfere
with this world are false one can fairly
conclude that when meaningless does not under the
pragmatic definition meaningless makes exist
even logically
problem with such statements that one disprove subjective god
and there might cases where subjective god would even
make the trouble with most god definitions that they include
some form objective existence with the consequence the gods affecting
believers derive from right interfere with the life
the faq clarified try pin down this notion
see the
benedikt
	case that everything wrong the world will end people start
and that horrors mankind are all caused the
for the last lack belief your god does not imply
just because some moslems moral does not mean they
believe god named although their allah may not the things

	you require the same amount evidence believe that

could use the argument that some here use about and claim
that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are superhuman
powers are beyond what human and since you are any powers
you have are not beyond those you cannot have superhuman
sound good
the evidence depends the this
since you are posting from american college willing take
given that you have pair blue assuming there some
coherency your will take given that you not have
superhuman arguments are evidence some
you say the sic assume that you
just the without any special
will agree that very possible that man called jesus did
fact willing agree that there was some man named
have reason believe that there ever
most the claims are virgin birth
virgin the sense not having any sexual intercourse
those claims require extra
why start with evidence
cannot see any evidence for the which the cynics this group would
ever for the the foundation the
anyone who claims have seen the risen jesus the day

strange about this story that should have even been
considered
there are couple things about your post and others this thread
that are little atheist one for whom all things can
understood processes nature there need
for any recourse divnity describe explain there
purpose direction for any event beyond those required
everything nothing
this would also have include human intelligence course and all
its there nothing requiring that life evolve that
acquire just happy for
event can preferred another said have more less
value than another any naturalistic and thought
event can have
the products our intelligence are acquired from our
from observation and experience and are only
significant the individual mind wherein they these mental
processes and the images they produce for are just electrical
activity and nothing content the human
mind much response natural forces water running down
how then can atheist judge what the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated the bible the purposes imputed
what grounds can the the behavior the reliogious
seems judging the values that motivate others you
have have some standard against which conduct but what
nature can serve that what law nature can you invoke
establish your
since every event entirely and exclusively physical what
difference could possibly make what religious
there can gradation the only
way atheist can object behaviour admit that the
objection entirely subjective and that just like
any value judgement must prefaced the disclaimer
that nothing more than matter personal opinion and carries
weight any
that you like what god told people says nothing about god
says only that there was electrical event your
nervous system that created emotional state that your mind coupled
with form that that your
objections well founded due the way been
there the whole your
intellectual landscape virtual
make these inherent naturalistic atheism and
you have accept the any human
even your all this being you have excluded
yourself from any discussion
and cannot your opinion about the bible can have
weight
bill
	could you explain what any this pertains this position
statement something typing and why are you using
you think this relates anything said and
bill
	course people say what they think the and that this
not exactly the same coming from different people within the
there nothing with there existing different perspectives
the religion perhaps one can say that they tend converge
point that they are doing lot harm the way the
that they converge religions appear split and
even when there might the the layers
determine what happens and they are quite inhumane
you post then supposed but see what has
with what
will repeat religions are harm and religions
they giving more disagree and there lot
disagreement whom one should tolerant one should
ideologies also giving more disagree and may also lead
you also oppose all
think your argument argument against religion but
just points out the weaknesses human
women have souls
have said here that some muslims say that women not have
must admit have never heard such view being held
any have heard some christians some eras
this but not are you sure you might not
christian history with islamic
supposed have been predominant view the turkish
would like reference you have got for this news
that women are the spiritual equals men can clearly shown
many verses the for the
muslim men and
believing men and
devout men and
true men and
men and women who are patient and
men and women who humble
men and women who give
men and women who fast deny
men and women who guard their
for men and women who engage much praise
them has god prepared forgiveness and great
abdullah yusuf
are other quotes but think the above quote shows that men
women are spiritual equals that women have souls just
very
does implies that they have but does not say they
and not given that the quote above given high
all
one must approach the with any thinking approach
the cannot but interpret the above verse and others like
that women and men are spiritual
think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have
does make any sense for something without soul
have great reward the
think the usual answer would which the
part saying them has god prepared forgiveness and great
says they have
makes sense say that things without souls can then
have idea soul
for your saying that the quote above may not given high priority
all any thinking approach the has give
all verses the equal that according
muslim the the revelation god
denying the truth any part the sufficient
considered disbeliever
similar you other even when the quran does not encourage
not justified say that iit forbids puts end
non
any approach the must done with intelligence and
this fashion that one can try understand the
book finite cannot explicitly
answer every question you want put but through its teachings
can guide that women are the spiritual equals
men clearly and unambiguously implied the above and that
since women can clearly and they have
souls the above
try understand what the trying rather than
try see how many ways can misinterpreted ignoring this
passage that the misinterpretations the based
ignoring this verse that verse are but the interpretations
fully consistent are more try discuss these
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can
ignore this bit that for that just showing how people can try
twist islam for their own ends something not deny but
provides reflection the true teachings islam
fred rice
	might not like what bernard lewis writes label him
zionist such discredit him
you misrepresent the hard evidence for statements about
his lack objectivity are presented quite clearly the book
edward edward the
not
think
much objective his treatment and slavery
middle since clearly distinguishes between
under and the practice slavery other
the prior the civil also does not conceal
there are verses the quran which promote the liberation
what and think nobody
from these verses that slavery will eventually
islamic now you rather
the practice slavery but the facts are out
also fail see the relevance the claim lewis being
what
regarding bernard
him being zionist gives him political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and about
read edward said see the evidence for
may post some here too
were encyclopaedic information
anybody can access that slavery was abolished certain
some years after that this was the cause
tensions the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders
the government also have the asu library volumes
british documents slavery where reports and documents
slavery all around the world can which
some the incidents lewis think
political stance has anything with documentary
read comment directly upon and
have only spoken about his writings that his
political motives make him biased writer his
understand are often quite subtle and are often based
telling
read edward asking you take
what say fact urging you not but get
this book and check the evidence out for
issue raised was that slaves were used for sexual
was claimed that islam prohibits
wrote that the prophet himself had wrote
which the prophet advised someone who did not
his concubine get pregnant which contrary
the notion that for procreation other
such claims are baseless the quran and the
slavery opposed the practice some
opposed then using slaves for sexual
purposes necessarily opposed
seem unsuccesful getting through islam
slavery was existing institution the
advised slaves being freed for good
which nothing many cultures saw this
what the problem but can argue rightfully
slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses
the quran rewards the good obey your
and perhaps one day very
that not communicate with since
assume the quran from and think
imposed the society for preservation the status
are part this the subordination women
that their function society boils down
part this
understand your point selim
who are not getting through
some the points you repeat above have already answered
regarding have made posting after posting this
showing that islam not have you been
completely ignoring postings just missing just reposted
very good under the title and reposted from
this has already disappeared from your

excellent
your understanding the issue women islam sadly
regarding posting slavery the second one
which repost article wrote early last year based
completely the and contains numerous verses and
hadiths support its point
our approaches are different you are arguing from historical
standpoint and arguing directly from the teachings the
and just because people say they are muslims and perform
particular does that automatically mean that their action
part even opposed the and
course
let give you concrete which might help clarify this for
the prohibits person says
and then proceeds drink bottle does this now mean
that islam teaches that people should drink course and
only idiot would think
you see
very natural think that
the quran had idea that the
they were advocating would experience least two paradigm
years the western cultures first with the end
feudal era and the rise second with the industrial
rules have changed and the status quo has driven
countries into misery trying survive
countries have failed they were unable
any wealth directly due the uncomprimising economic
the the rise islam can easily modeled
the pyramid effect you not produce any wealth
increase your wealth conquering
you are judging islam here capitalist capitalism
ideology based largely the assumption that people want maximise
their wealth this assumption opposition islamic
say islam bad because not capitalist pretty unthinking
islam does not pretend capitalist and does not try
does not mean that islam does not support
for does general but there are other parts
capitalism which are opposed islam understand
this
were left bare the open for emperialists
very poor social services the education
muslim countries are the lowest the the health
are miserable
one can postulate numerous reasons for your theory that
because islam not secularist and
will give you clear historical example show you the
fallacy your views you think you obviously that
islam lack education and
for large part the islamic world was very for
significant section the islamic world was the foremost
the say that islam for
completely you try blame this situation islam history
shows that your conclusion false and there must
other reasons for this
blame muslims for not following the but blame muslims
following the
your viewpoint women islam makes question the extent
your knowledge really think you are not
knowledgeable enough able judge whether the muslims are
following the
idea baseless from historical
poor
the islamic world was the forefront the world science one
stage yet your the
that muslims are backwards thesis
that for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your
ideas are derived from social
economic
you have certainly not shown you have merely stated
seems that your view islam being
quite contrary that you are convinced your views
makes wonder just how objectively you are trying look all
solution all muslims
the
you should consider taking your own
the facts straight
here
work hard reverse
effects years
you have such conviction your yet you demonstrate
not only islam but also islamic history
with respect muslims being leaders science till about
yet you say that your viewpoint based
remember you say one your earlier posts that
you are apostate from think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the and start some our
postings about islam rather than ignoring them you obviously
fred rice
	poster casually trashed two thousand years jewish and
replied that there had previously been people like him
think the problem here that pretty much ignored the part
about the jews sightseeing for thinking instead that
the important part what the original poster said was the bit
about killing can see how the
sightseeing thing would offensive originally saw
just poetic but understandable that others
might see still think that ken came bit
strong also think that your advice masud
you argue with someone like good idea
little least
was
there have there have also been people who
formally but the nazi party would have gone nowhere
the active and tacit support the ordinary man the
who behaved though casual was perfectly
what exactly you understand about what and why
you see what has with the matter
throughout all your articles this thread there the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
agreed with then maybe your speech
why this bad might have been but think
reading lot into one flip while probably not
true this too often the charge gets
thrown around order stifle legitimate criticism the
state
rather somewhere outta this

questions
this file contains responses articles which occur repeatedly
points covered here are ones which are not covered the
you are advised read that article well
before
these answers are not intended exhaustive the purpose
the periodic faq postings not stifle but raise its
you have something say concerning one these questions and which
covered the answer please feel free make your
overview
the purpose this
was
bible proves
good believe
know that god
and does not play
worships
there must causeless
universe complex must have been
evidence that the bible
incompleteness
bush atheism and
know where hell
contradictions
usa christian
usa not christian
what the purpose this
typical
why have newsgroup about why atheists organize
what there
many things are discussed
whether reasonable feign theism order avoid upsetting
family
prayer schools
discrimination against atheists
sunday trading laws
the satanic child abuse myth
whether one should overt atheist the
how religious societies prey new college students
how get rid unwanted proselytizers
whether religion danger society the individual
why people become atheists
inevitably tends attract evangelical christians
looking for someone most readers the newsgroup
want preached although few seem derive perverse pleasure
from tearing apart particularly uninformed
hitler was
typical
hitler was and look what
adolf hitler was emphatically not said
the has the sacred each
his own making
for will gave men their their and their
anyone who destroys his work declaring war the
the divine let every man
each his own denomination you and let every
man take his first and most sacred duty oppose anyone who
his activity word deed steps outside the confines his
religious community and tries butt into the
hence today believe that acting accordance with the will
the almighty
adolf from ralph
someone bad believing something does not make that belief
also entirely possible that hitler was lying when claimed
believe certainly conclude that
the bible proves
typical
the bible says
most the readers feel that the bible questionable
was written thousands years ago many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years any claimed
questionable this say that the
bible has truth simply that any truth must examined before being
many the readers this group also feel that because any passage
subject any claim that passage one thing and
one thing only not
note that this feeling tends extend other
also remarkable many atheists that theists tend ignore other
equally plausible religious books favour those their own
wager
typical
you believe god and turn out you have lost nothing
but you believe god and turn out you will
therefore foolish
this argument known has several
does not indicate which religion there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out this often
described the the wrong person
follower religion may end religion version
the statement that you believe god and turn out
you have lost not suppose believing
the wrong god the true god might punish you for your
consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine
favour
another flaw the argument that based the assumption that
the two possibilities are equally likely that they are
comparable the possibility there being god
close the argument becomes much less sadly the
argument only likely convince those who believe
many feel that for intellectually honest belief based
with some amount not matter will
formally the argument consists four
one does not know whether god
not believing god bad for eternal soul god does
believing god consequence god does not
therefore interest believe
there are two approaches the the first view
and consequence one problem with this
the that creates information from this
considered invalid information statement indicates one has
information about god but statement indicates that beneficial information
can gained from the absolute lack information about this violates
information entropy information has been extracted from
the alternative approach claim that and are both the
problem with this that then basically assumption which states the
christian and only christian will agree with that the
argument thus collapses you are your interests
believe rather vacuous and not the way pascal
intended the argument
the biggest reason why wager failure that god
omniscient will certainly know who really believes and who believes
will spurn the assuming actually cares all
whether people believe
what
typical
people keep talking about what
william occam formulated principle which has become known
its original said not multiply entities
that you can explain something without supposing
the existence some then
nowadays when people refer they generally express
more for example the simplest
the relevance atheism that can look two possible explanations
for what see around
there incredibly intricate and complex universe out which
came into being result natural
there incredibly intricate and complex universe out and
there also god who created the clearly this god must
given that both explanations fit the razor might suggest
that should take the simpler the two solution number
some argue that there third even more simple
there incredibly intricate and complex universe out
just imagine that there
this third option leads logically towards which many people
find
why good believe jesus
typical
want tell people about the virtues and benefits
preaching not
feel free talk about your but please not write postings that
are such postings not belong and
will rejected from the newsgroup
you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists your favourite
newsgroup attempt convert please unto others you would
have them unto
often theists make their basic claims about god the form lengthy
analogies aware that atheists have heard god and know the
basic claims about the sole purpose your parable tell
atheists that god exists and brings you may well not post
since tells nothing have not been told
why know that god exists
typical
from personal experience and prayer that god
just many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
many atheists have personal evidence that such beings not
that evidence varies from person
without wishing dismiss your evidence out many
people have claimed all kinds unlikely things that they have been
abducted visited the ghost and
einstein and does not play
typical
albert einstein believed you think cleverer than
einstein did once comment that does not play dice the
this quotation commonly mentioned show that einstein believed the
christian used this out refers
refusal accept the uncertainties indicated quantum
religious background was jewish rather than
better quotation showing what einstein thought about god the
believe god who reveals himself the orderly harmony
what not god who concerns himself with fates and actions
human
einstein was unable accept quantum theory because his belief
orderly reality which would not subject random
events and which would not dependent upon the believed that
was and that better theory would have need for
statistical far such better theory has been
and much evidence suggests that never will
longer quote from einstein appears and
published the conference philosophy and religion
their relation the democratic way new
more man imbued with the ordered regularity all events
the firmer becomes his conviction that there room left the side
this ordered regularity for causes different for him
neither the rule human nor the rule divine will exists
independent cause natural the doctrine
personal god interfering with natural events could never
the real for this
doctrine can always take refuge those domains which scientific
knowledge has not yet been able set
but convinced that such behavior the part representatives
religion would not only unworthy but also for doctrine
which maintain itself not clear light but only the
will necessity lose its effect with incalculable harm
human their struggle for the ethical teachers
religion must have the stature give the doctrine personal
that give that source fear and hope which the past
placed such vast power the hands their labors they
will have avail themselves those forces which are capable
cultivating the the and the beautiful humanity
this more difficult but incomparably
more worthy
einstein has also
lie what you read about religous
lie which being systematically not believe
personal god and have never denied this but have expressed
something which can called religious then the
unbounded admiration for the structure the world far our
science can reveal
the latter quote from the human edited helen
dukas and banesh and published princeton university
also from the same
not believe immortality the and consider ethics
exclusively human concern with superhuman authority behind
the fact that einstein chose not believe christianity does
not itself imply that christianity
everyone worships something
typical
everyone worships whether power
that everyone theists care just much about
those things that atheists care the reactions
their families amount worship then the
why there must causeless cause
typical
sets integers that have lower bound each have smallest
chains causes must all have first causeless
the set real numbers greater than zero has definite lower but has
smallest
even true that there must causeless that does
not imply that that cause must conscious supernatural and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured
any particular
the universe complex must have been designed
typical
the presence design the universe proves there surely you
think all this appeared here just
this known the argument from
matter dispute whether there any element design the
those who believe that the complexity and diversity living
creatures the earth evidence creator are best advised read the
newsgroup for
there insufficient space summarize both sides that debate
the conclusion that there scientific evidence favour
scientific there much
observation and theory that can explain many the complexities the
universe and life
the origin the argument design feeling that the existence
something incredibly intricate human improbable that
surely have come about that surely there must some
external intelligence directing things that humans come from the chaos
but human intelligence surely the existence mind
capable fashioning entire universe complete with conscious beings must
immeasurably more the approach used argue favour the
existence creator can turned around and applied the creationist
this leads the familiar theme creator created the
what created the but with the addition spiralling
the only way out declare that the creator was not
created and just
from here might well ask what wrong with saying that the universe
just without introducing indeed stephen his book
brief history explains his theory that the universe closed
and finite with beginning
the argument from design often stated the
watchmaker one asked imagine that one has found watch
the does one assume that was created that
evolved course one assumes yet like the
the universe intricate and the argument the
universe too must have
the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular over and above
those common all arguments watchmaker creates
watches from whereas god claimed have
created the universe from these two sorts creation are
clearly fundamentally and the analogy therefore rather
watchmaker makes but there are many other things
the walked further along the beach and found nuclear
assume was created the the argument
would therefore suggest multitude each responsible for
different part
the first part the watchmaker argument conclude that
the watch not part nature because and therefore
stands out from the randomness yet the second part the
start from the position that the universe obviously not
but shows elements the watchmaker argument thus
internally
independent evidence that the bible true
typical
the events the new testament are confirmed independent documentary
for
the writings josephus are often mentioned independent documentary
early versions work are thought not have mentioned jesus
the extant version discusses john many
scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james but
that this was expanded christian several
the original text have been published this
much information appears the ecclesiastical history eusebius
worthless historical material because the deliberate
falsification the wily eusebius who generally acknowledged
first thoroughly dishonest historian eusebius who
generally given the title authorship for this
aside from the new the biographical information about jesus

asked questions file for the newsgroup
incompleteness theorem
typical
incompleteness theorem demonstrates that impossible for the
bible both true and
first incompleteness theorem says that any consistent formal
system which sufficiently expressive that can model ordinary
one can formulate expressions which can never proven
valid invalid within that formal
the system must also that there must decision
procedure for determining whether given string axiom within the formal
all such systems can formulate what known
the classic liar paradox sentence ordinary english
sentence note that proposition the formal
system cannot even deduce that
the logic used theological discussions rarely well claims
that incompleteness theorem demonstrates that impossible
prove the existence god are worthless
one can trivially define formal system which possible prove the
existence simply having the existence god stated
this unlikely viewed atheists convincing
may possible succeed producing formal system built axioms
that both atheists and theists agree may then possible show
that incompleteness theorem holds for that that
would still not demonstrate that impossible prove that god exists
within the certainly tell anything about
whether possible prove the existence god
note also that all these hypothetical formal systems tell nothing about
the actual existence the formal systems are just
another frequent claim that incompleteness theorem demonstrates
that religious text the book mormon cannot
both consistent and universally religious texts are not formal
such claims are
george bush atheism and patriotism
typical
did george bush really say that atheists should not considered
the following exchange took place the chicago airport between robert
sherman american atheist press and george august sherman

know where hell
typical
know where hell hell
there are several towns called various countries around the
including norway and the whilst this information mildly
amusing the first time one hears readers are now
getting pretty fed with hearing every
biblical contradictions wanted
typical
does anyone have list biblical
american atheist press publish handbook detailing biblical

the usa christian nation

	logic
april
constructing logical argument
although there much argument the general quality argument
found this article attempts provide gentle introduction
the hope improving the general level
logic the science inference
logic allows analyze piece reasoning and determine whether
correct not one does not need
study logic order reason little basic
knowledge logic often helpful when constructing analyzing
note that claim being made here about whether logic universally
the matter very much open for this document merely
explains how use given that you have already decided that logic
the right tool for the
propositions are the building blocks logical
proposition statement which either true for
propositions may either asserted
denied note that this technical meaning
not the everyday
the proposition the meaning the not the particular
arrangement words used express and exists
both express the same
argument quote the monty python connected series
statements establish definite argument consists
three
first the propositions which are necessary for the argument
continue are these are called the premises the they
are the evidence reasons for accepting the argument and its
premises are often indicated phrases such
and phrase often viewed with
can used intimidate others into accepting suspicious
something seem obvious afraid
question you can always say when
heard the
the premises are used derive further propositions process known
one proposition arrived the basis
one more other propositions already there are various forms
valid
the propositions arrived inference may then used further
inference often denoted phrases such
arrive the conclusion the argument the proposition which
affirmed the basis the premises and conclusions are often
indicated phrases such follows
and the conclusion often stated the final stage
for
every event has cause
the universe has beginning
all beginnings involve event
this implies that the beginning the universe involved event
therefore the universe has cause and
note that the conclusion one argument might premise another
proposition can only called premise conclusion with
respect particular the terms not make sense
sometimes argument will not follow the order given for
the conclusions might stated first and the premises stated
afterwards support the this perfectly
sometimes little
recognizing argument much harder than recognizing premises
many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe some
statements look like but are for
the bible jesus must either have been evil
the son
this not conditional does not assert
the premises which are necessary support what appears its
also suffers from number other logical but
come those
another
created therefore your duty
the phrase your duty not since neither
true nor therefore not and the sentence not
causality consider statement the form because
interested establishing and offered the
statement trying establish the truth then
not
for
must something wrong with the engine because will not
this
car will not start because there something wrong with the
this
there are two traditional types deductive and
deductive argument one which provides conclusive proof its conclusions
that argument where the premises are the conclusion must
also deductive argument either valid valid
argument defined one where the premises are then the
conclusion
inductive argument one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth the inductive arguments are not valid
can talk about whether they are better worse than other
and about how probable their premises
there are forms argument ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor will concentrate for the moment deductive
they are often viewed the most rigorous and
important note that the fact that deductive argument valid does
not imply that its conclusion this because the slightly
nature which must now consider more
obviously valid argument can consist true
argument may entirely valid even contains only false
for
all insects have wings
woodlice are insects
therefore woodlice have wings
the conclusion not true because the premises are
the premises were the conclusion would
the argument thus entirely
more can reach true conclusion from one more false
all fish live the sea
dolphins are fish
therefore dolphins live the sea
the one thing cannot reach false conclusion through valid
inference from true can therefore draw for
the symbol denotes the the
and represent true and false
premise conclusion inference
the premises are false and the inference
the conclusion can true
the premises are true and the conclusion
the inference must
the premises are true and the inference
the conclusion must
sound argument valid argument whose premises are sound
argument therefore arrives true careful not confuse
valid arguments with sound
delve further into the structure logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion linguistics and simpler and probably
more useful summarize the major pitfalls avoided when constructing
these pitfalls are known
everyday english the term used refer mistaken beliefs
well the faulty reasoning that leads those this fair
but logic the term generally used refer form
technically incorrect especially the argument appears valid
for the purposes this define fallacy logical
argument which appears but which can seen incorrect
when examined more studying fallacies aim avoid being
misled the following list fallacies not intended
argumentum baculum
the appeal force committed when the arguer resorts force the
threat force order try and push the acceptance
often used and can summarized makes
the force threatened need not direct threat from the
for
thus there ample proof the truth the all those who
refuse accept that truth will burn
argumentum hominem
argumentum hominem literally directed the
the abusive variety argumentum hominem occurs instead trying
disprove the truth the arguer attacks the person
people making the this invalid because the truth
assertion does not depend upon the goodness those asserting
for
evil practised communists and
sometimes court law doubt cast upon the testimony witness
for that known this valid way
reducing the credibility the testimony given the and not
argumentum does not demonstrate that the
testimony conclude otherwise fall victim the
argumentum ignorantiam elsewhere this
the circumstantial form argumentum hominem committed when person
argues that his opponent ought accept the truth assertion because
the particular
for
perfectly acceptable kill animals for how can you argue
otherwise when quite happy wear leather
this abusive charge used excuse for dismissing
the
this fallacy can also used means rejecting for
course you would argue that positive discrimination bad
this particular form argumentum when one alleges that
adversary rationalizing conclusion formed from selfish
also known the
argumentum ignorantium
argumentum ignorantium means from this fallacy
occurs whenever argued that something must true simply because
has not been proved when argued that
something must false because has not been proved that this
not the same assuming that something false until has been proved
basic scientific
course the bible nobody can prove
course telepathy and other psychic phenomena not nobody has
shown any proof that they are
note that this fallacy does not apply court where one
generally assumed innocent until proven
scientific investigation known that event would produce
certain evidence its having the absence such evidence can
validly used infer that the event did not for
flood described the bible would require enormous volume water
present the the earth does not have tenth much
even count that which frozen into ice the therefore
such flood
can validly assume from lack evidence that something has
not cannot conclude with certainty that has not
argumentum misericordiam
this the appeal also known special the fallacy
committed when the arguer appeals pity for the sake getting
conclusion for
did not murder mother and father with please find
suffering enough through being
argumentum populum
this known appealing the appealing the
commit this fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion
appealing large group this form fallacy often
characterized emotive for
must violence against
bible must millions people know that are you trying
tell them that they are all mistaken
argumentum numeram
this fallacy closely related the argumentum consists
asserting that the more people who support believe the more
likely that that proposition
argumentum verecundiam
the appeal authority uses the admiration the famous try and win
support for for
newton was genius and believed
this line argument not always completely for reference
admitted authority particular field may relevant
discussion that for can distinguish quite clearly
hawking has concluded that black holes give off
and
searle has concluded that impossible build intelligent
hawking and can reasonably expect his opinions black
hole radiation searle questionable
whether speak the subject machine
the fallacy accident
the fallacy accident committed when general rule applied
particular case whose circumstances mean that the rule
the error made when one goes from the general the
for
generally dislike you are you must
dislike
this fallacy often committed moralists and legalists who try decide
every moral and legal question mechanically applying general
converse accident hasty generalization
this fallacy the reverse the fallacy occurs when one
forms general rule examining only few specific cases which are not
representative all possible
for
bakker was insincere therefore all christians are
sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter
sweeping generalization occurs when general rule applied
particular situation which the features that particular situation
render the rule sweeping generalization the opposite
hasty
non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc
these are known false cause
the fallacy non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something the
cause event but has not actually been shown the for
took aspirin and prayed and headache god
cured the
the fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something assumed
the cause event merely because happened before the for
soviet union collapsed after taking therefore must avoid
atheism for the same
cum hoc ergo propter hoc
this fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter asserts that
because two events occur they must causally and leaves
room for other factors that may the the
petitio principii
this fallacy occurs when the premises are least questionable the
conclusion
circulus demonstrando
this fallacy occurs when one assumes premise the conclusion which one
wishes the proposition will rephrased that the
fallacy appears valid for
must not allowed hold government hence any
government official who revealed homosexual will lose his
therefore homosexuals will anything hide their and will open
therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government
note that the argument entirely the premise the same the
argument like the above has actually been cited the reason
for the british secret official ban homosexual
another example the
know that god exists because the bible tells and know that the
bible true because the word
complex question fallacy interrogation
this the fallacy one example the classic loaded
you stopped beating your
the question presupposes definite answer another question which has not
even been this trick often used lawyers
when they ask questions
did you hide the money you
politicians often ask loaded questions such
long will this interference our affairs allowed
the chancellor plan two more years ruinous
ignoratio elenchi
the fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming that argument
supports particular conclusion when actually logically nothing
with that
for christian may begin saying that will argue that the
teachings christianity are undoubtably then argues length
that christianity great help many matter how well
argues will not have shown that christian teachings are
such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others view the supposed conclusion more
favourable
equivocation
equivocation occurs when key word used with two more different
meanings the same for
could more affordable than free but make sure that
remains that users can what they like with must place
license make sure that will always freely
amphiboly
amphiboly occurs when the premises used argument are ambiguous because
careless ungrammatical
accent
accent another form fallacy through shifting this
the meaning changed altering which parts statement are
for
should not speak ill our
and
should not speak ill our
fallacies composition
one fallacy composition conclude that property shared the parts
something must apply the for
bicycle made entirely low mass and therefore very
the other fallacy composition conclude that property number
individual items shared collection those for
car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than
fallacy division
the fallacy division the opposite the fallacy like
its exists two the first assume that
property some thing must apply its for
are studying rich therefore you must
the other assume that property collection items shared
each for
can destroy therefore this ant can destroy
the slippery slope argument
this argument states that should one event will other harmful
there proof made that the harmful events are caused the
first
for
legalize then would have legalize crack and heroin
and have nation full therefore cannot
legalize
based fallacies type fallacies
these fallacies occur when one attempts argue that things are some way
similar without actually specifying what way they are
history based upon then the bible also form
based christianity based islam
form
are form animal based carbon dogs are form
animal based carbon dogs form
affirmation the consequent
this fallacy argument the form implies therefore
understand why examine the truth table for
implication given
denial the antecedent
this fallacy argument the form implies therefore
the truth table for implication makes clear why this
note that this fallacy different from non causa pro the latter has
the form implies therefore where does not
fact imply the problem not that the implication
rather that the falseness does not allow deduce
anything about
converting conditional
this fallacy argument the form then therefore then
argumentum antiquitam
this the fallacy asserting that something right good simply
because because the way always
argumentum novitam
this the opposite the argumentum the fallacy
asserting that something more correct simply because new newer
than something
argumentum crumenam
the fallacy believing that money criterion that those
with more money are more likely
argumentum lazarum
the fallacy assuming that because someone poor she sounder
more virtuous than one who this fallacy the opposite the
argumentum
argumentum nauseam
this the incorrect belief that assertion more likely true the
more often one that employs
constant repetition asserting
bifurcation
also referred the and bifurcation occurs when
one presents situation having only two where fact other
alternatives exist can
plurium interrogationum many questions
this fallacy occurs when questioner demands simple answer complex
non sequitur
argument where the conclusion drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with
red herring
this fallacy committed when irrelevant material introduced the issue
being that attention diverted away from the
points being towards different
reification hypostatization
reification occurs when abstract concept treated concrete
shifting the burden proof
the burden proof always the person making assertion
shifting the burden special case argumentum
the fallacy putting the burden proof the person who
denies questions the assertion being the source the fallacy
the assumption that something true unless proven
straw man
the straw man fallacy misrepresent someone position that
can attacked more then knock down that misrepresented
then conclude that the original position has been
fallacy because fails deal with the actual arguments that have been
the extended analogy
the fallacy the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule being argued the fallacy assume that mentioning two
different argument about general constitutes
claim that those situations are analogous each
this fallacy best explained using real example from debate about
believe always wrong oppose the law breaking
position implies that you would not have supported
martin luther
you saying that cryptography legislation important the
struggle for black how dare

this the famous occurs when action argued
acceptable because the other party has performed for
just being randomly
been abusive

have got chill all could just relax
see atheism for what the funny pages could have more
denies the existence this logically bankrupt
the proof this
nobody can take the above sense atheism perhaps
perhaps because you just made
now put your skateboard away and read the learn something about atheism
before you get off these
	think there really any question about which god the courts
the request for solemnly help you
always made after request pick the bible your left hand
and hold your right the courts always
old and new
though hard picking the bible and swearing
god sometimes the least the religious there court
where the judge routinely has everyone the courtroom
stand join him prayer the beginning every thought about
sitting through but not terribly anxious spend days
	remember his last name
tally ryan
sandvick
kandolf
tims
clippendale
khan
with strom
fuller
useful hausmann
what about affectionate nickname for
you could take wrongly spelled surname
kent sandvik
	denies the existence this logically bankrupt
the proof this
this one favorite fallacious points against the
belief that you deny anything that you prove
this easily nailed showing that infinite number beings are
conceivable but not observed does this mean that would have
believe all according the above must believe
objects beings that been proved not exist why stop
could huge number beings identical ronald reagan
except for trivial say one missing one has blond
and they all live other planets see the
reason one but atheists bring this that none these christians
have vested interest these unknown beings with the exception
but why these people shoot themselves the foot and mock the idea
here again classic atheist
how did they shoot themselves the
the the inquisition are common examples that
like bring marks against how only fools can
that drivel how about the all human
stalinist
eight million people under this which
featured
there big difference stalin say that stood for
particular moral position against murder and and
then did the opposite the religious was least
honest not support stalin but attack this
saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
one man was tyrant and atheist just bad look all the
russians that helped stalin that atheists they contradict
your besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
his murdering this just the common assumption that atheists
value life much theists you
are not funny because they are more yet
some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence god
this itself every bit the assumption that atheism
less arrogant and
and another point you get out the atheist
have hold the positive view that god may
just have the the positive the
strong atheism believe god does not positive belief
weak atheism believe negative belief
these are not the some one that has never thought the idea
god their whole life technically but not the kind that
you are calling look this way
suppose that given person has huge set ideas that will represent
capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
exist real objects then the person
not believing santa but still having the idea but notice that
even itself another this means you have lots
christian where god
atheist
atheist all the set
agnostic
are people afraid say must just another
human nature not glamorous
does not inspire much hate not
not fact too often taken mean
nietzsche once said that man would rather will nonexistence than not
will all but the darwinist way put this that humanity always
prefers yes maybe because indecision not useful survival
evolution has drilled take even false
iii
	atheism based ignorance the
existence any fall into the believe
because their
you know based that why would
wrong
fall into the trap that you
god free any time correct that
continues not while supposedly proclaiming his
undying love for eternal speaks
what are the volumes that speaks besides the fact that leaves your
choices
for the you are not position tell that
believe god because not wish unless you can know
motivations better than you should believe when
say that earnestly searched for god for years and never found
definitely agree that rather presumptuous for either give some
psychological reasoning for

this back the guy says going
that sufficient cause bitch the system
bad you really believe that someone using his
without his which actually against the
saxton school
sufficient cause bitch the system operator this
was just some guy saying that atheists are going the point was
that recently many messages were posted from that each these
messages was posted different with the apparent intent
provoking the readers that particular along with the fact
that these posts were written makes these posts
whoever using this account using the
intended they should consider appropriate someone
which seems then this also reason report
get many posts the flavor the one that started this
only because have seen posts other groups this user that
considering
brendan
	thanks whoever posted this wonderful parody people who post without
reading the was laughing for good were there any
parts the faq that think there might have been one
please tell this not ready hear that
brendan
	there are couple things about your post and others this thread
that are little atheist one for whom all things can
understood processes nature
this definition does not include all atheists the
think there need invoke any divine
spiritual
makes big difference claim that all things can understood
natural and claim that our observations not
require postulate any divine anything
for that humans are not and neither
science has one advantage theology
with nature its
delightful see how scientific inquiry revealing
simple picture our science longer
bunch separate from particle physics
and aspect our our safe
from its stern and stony not even our
there need
for any recourse divnity describe explain there
purpose direction for any event beyond those required
everything nothing
determinism indeterminism philosophical
and science cannot say whether the whole thing actually somehow
superdeterministic think the question does not have
any far individual human beings their apparent
free will does not appear from their
can you say whether you have free
will
this would also have include human intelligence course and all
its there nothing requiring that life evolve that
acquire just happy
who are seems intelligence useful when
during the history earth has been able control
one third the whole this can still result
numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates
and even that machinery can result the same
principle only the systems that can start replicating will
those which make
for
event can preferred another said have more less
value than another any naturalistic and thought
event can have
from whose value events and things from
nature does not have because does not have
perspective values arise from have subjective
easy assume that other people also and
think about what would like their will
eventually discover the golden morality not necessarily
gift from may product
perhaps are aware ourselves because sense identity
allows play the roles others and make respect
others who seem have
have you ever read try his ethica nikomakhea
for
how then can atheist judge what the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated the bible the purposes imputed
what grounds can the the behavior the reliogious
seems judging the values that motivate others you
have have some standard against which conduct but what
nature can serve that what law nature can you invoke
establish your
lewis tells that this argument was the main reason why
abandoned his atheism and became the argument
severely
some such the golden can have rational some
like the basic idea wanting has probably its
roots the way our brains are lewis ignored the very real
possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic
and morality humans evolved better
and better building and using they also became better
killing each logical necessity that evolution could
only favour those who knew how use but not against
own
the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality the early jews
was not beyond simple set rules hold the people
under one their god did not care much about people
other
the time the things were quite different the jews
were under rule and could longer simply ignore
the new situation required new and along
with new religion was mutation meme
since every event entirely and exclusively physical what
difference could possibly make what religious
there can gradation the only
way atheist can object behaviour admit that the
objection entirely subjective and that just like
any value judgement must prefaced the disclaimer
that nothing more than matter personal opinion and carries
weight any
looks like you bothered read whenever there
there subjective point which may
value its existence and happiness that were just result
some physical and the observer
comes think about absolutely objective that
without any observers moral judgments lose their
not possible for value simply exist without point
this includes their values are only
personal not absolute since such truths
not
the fact that most people not deliberately want hurt others
manifestation the way have fought for our existence
becoming social beings who can think and value
morality not property humans alone dolphins and
many other species show great care for each dolphins have
sometimes saved humans from good deed
that you like what god told people says nothing about god
says only that there was electrical event your
nervous system that created emotional state that your mind coupled
with form that that your
objections well founded due the way been
there the whole your
intellectual landscape virtual
the last statement does not logically there
every reason believe our thoughts can model reality very
and our senses can convey reliable solipsism
still logical but not very likely
you are continuously mixing two different the subjective
point view all and objective point
does not any observer any personal
has its own point does not matter whether this point
view result some physical events does not
cease
from values not neither
does such things are
inherently
once god wants wives submit their even
make leap faith into the wants punish
disagree with his not think morals come
from any supreme being remove morals means the same than
make machine without single god
gave morality but disagree with not
free replace cannot see what the
point giving someone moral system which disagrees with
own and then get mad
god must
all this being you have excluded
yourself from any discussion
and cannot your opinion about the bible can have
weight
neither can the opinion any for that cannot understand
why subjective opinion thing made matter any way
less credible than opinion thing made something
take absolute values must independent
god has subjective his
own point and his morals are his

arguements uses summing the book about whether
was god know many you but listen
perspective for all have something gain listening what
have
different different
book says that jesus was either was crazy
day was actually who said
perhaps big was just mistaken about some his
perhaps was normally but had few off perhaps
many the statements attributed jesus were not made
but were put into his mouth later other possibilities
someone seriously examining this question could
come with decent list possible unless the task
not serious examination the question less
but rather religious

around him and kept doing many gathered from hearing seeing
who was had been call but believe did
everyone who performs healing
was would more than entire nation drawn
someone who was
probably hard entire nation you unless you
are
fact for example
who drawn david koresh obviously logical people see
right
since liar must have been the
anyone who convinced this laughable logic deserves

	really think you can imagine what like
first infinity mathematical concept created humans
explain certain things certain know actually
applies know anything the world
able
what reality like for the because that would
infinite memory whatever because reality continuous and
infinietely small
you know the universe actually continuum another
mathematical concept used explain things certain
humans not know what infinite call something
call but not know what
have pretty good idea what infinity and
like many has evolved through ancient greeks had
different understanding
can call allah infinitely yet
imagine what allah actually because just cannot imagine
like
even know infinity applies

should for khomeini and his ilk publicly
clean and show their proof that islamic law punishes
with death that tolerates any similar form
freedom
all five schools law the best support the
death sentence for apostasy when accompanied
and aggravated hostility otherwise
there legal support for punishment
the makes clear that belief matter public
private disavowal islam conversion another faith not
punishable are some jurists who have gone against this
trend and insisted that apostasy punishable but
historically they are the
cursing and insulting the prophets falls under the category
just borrowed book from the library fatwa
stuff
according the above looks like offering
reward for death fact constitutes criminal act
according islamic
please see post under yet more rushdie
	historical evidence such islamic states
people are and even you might

martin schulte
	take wild guess and say freedom objectively base
this the assumption that everyone the world were deprived utterly
their freedom that their every act was contrary their
almost all would want therefore take that assert
believe that not very when almost everyone can see
that every bit absurd assert not
rainy take this candidate for objective and
necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
such this
own personal and highly subjective opinion that freedom
good
when here people assert that the only freedom
following the words this and that realise
that people even agree the meaning the
what does mean say that word represents objective
value when word has objective

adam john often have laughed the weaklings
who thought themselves good simply because
	want start right out and say that
what all the rest them who come here
makes sense have any you read tony
the real might little off the but
writes the anyway was part effort destroy
the process became christian
this the guy who was lawyer was could you give more info this
guy sure there will plenty responses this and
will appear
arguements uses summing the book about whether
jesus was god know many you but listen
different perspective for all have something gain listening what
others have
this make sure true for all
book says that jesus was either was crazy
why not
modern day was actually who said
reasons why liar are who would
die for people able tell was
why not die for you were poverty stricken and sounds
perfecetly reasoable whether the societal dregs had for
followers would able tell was liar not
even died for what believed this still makes him completely
like the
people
gathered around him and kept doing many gathered from hearing seeing
someone who was had been call but believe did
heal
there historical proof this earlier
least his have been the cause enough deaths make for whatever
healing
was would more than entire nation drawn
someone who was
sieg
fact for example
anyone who drawn david koresh obviously logical people see
this right
who david
therefore since liar must have been the
real
how does this your definition lunatic thereof seem
other things fulfilled loads prophecies
the isaiah and elsewhere hrs this his betrayal
and have bible with this next time
write will use
good
think most people understand what christian
certainly not what see lot
those not true
rather think
should way and total sacrafice everything for
loved enough die and save should the
hey god himself inspires turn our lives
over tuff and most people want
real christian would something for the strong persevere but
just like weight lifting guitar whatever takes
rush one christianity your whole
not going church once helping poor people once
box everything into time such work this
social god above these boxes and should
carried with into all these boxes that have created for
someone else handle know worth
adam john often have laughed the weaklings
who thought themselves good simply because
	christianity infectious the reasons flourishes are
because gives people without hope driven purpose life
safety blanked hide have
follow this christian moral standard and get eternal
agree that many cases primitive emotional feelings based
you laugh mentalities makes certain religions
very attractive for certain
agree with both but would like make small
other dogmatic not only attract people without hope etc but
also attract people believe that thru
its escapist doctrines absolutist provides great psychological
shelter from unhappiness fear uncertainty
unknown
this good but think people not take christianity
much out fear quite way improve their
social get more involved with american they are kids
immigrants for since the overwhelming major religion the
western world some form simply the choice people take
they are bored and want something new with their but not somethong
too too out the seems little but long
hurt
the buddha had something say about the attractiveness
driven man worships sacred sacred
sacred
the buddha also
somebody finds peace any let him
these are good and agree with both but make sure
alter the scond one that includes something like him long
not preventing others from finding their something like
someone were really there would
need for inflicting
feel that since religion have such poweful
psychological should let theists but the problem that
religions cause enormous harm and humanity whole
impedence science
intellectual attitudes etc need say
really know what can about any
sure thing will have live with them all our their
popularity seems come and remember when first entered high
was atheist had and were about this
those have always christianity were all also
immigrants from sons hence earlier gross
christianity seems lot more popular people now than
ever has before been maybe just perceptions
that are who
for one perfectly willing live and let live with long
have some set abstract how should treat each
have desire hurt them their for all the
arguments this never does any argumentation does not
really seem apply christians even some must simply
step the person takes
best
adam john often have laughed the weaklings
who thought themselves good simply because
the unenlightened one
has the characteristics what would

	your posting provoked into checking save file for memorable
the first captured was ken arromdee feb the
subject atheist that was article your question
was article which average about articles day for
the last three others have the current posting rate
such that kill file depressing among the posting
saved the early days were articles from the following
interesting wonder where
they made the whole thing great
four two thousand years over the tear garden
	think that you are confusing the words and
objective system simply one which outside observer
the postulates the could perfectly judge any situation
action consistent with the system not you seem
objecting because the goals the system are not that
seem want define objective system one which the
themselves could determined some outside
think that this good definition objective
you need learn
objective anybody can learn what and perform
they will get the same results every other person who
performed those
gravity inherent you need any excess information
other than observations determine possible objectively
determine guilt innocence within
agree that morality not necessarily inherent you state that
everything has evolutionary but this does not mean that
cannot objective
not objective evidenced
comments about and
perhaps can but not noted
the practices related mating among the animals are likely
the only ones considered under the previous
the natural some revisions are since the
class activities surrounding mating seem pose some general
the only way that the postulates could determined
would there were some sort higher like some
god not think that god necessary
objective while seems that you
are you trying say
seens that you are objecting the notion objective system
because perhaps you think that would imply which would
necessitate some sort grand
have classified behavior most animals line with
certainly possible for animals commit acts
are outside their rules but they seem
very perhaps they are not intelligent enough
perhaps because you have yet define
think code ethics which basically defines undesired
immoral behavior could
depending the goal the system
immoral what
keith
	morality may specifically thought code ethics that
certain species has developed order
are talking about ethics morals
the distinction
see this countless
the animal and such system the basis for

our moral system seems mimic the natural number
order for humans seem need
live
your wrong with the highlighted
what possible for humans survive for
long time the but humans
are social and that cause our
order for group function
some sort ethical
statement not
why you think
pointing out that conduct serves propogate
not trying give you your but trying show that
are examples moral systems with propogation the species
goal natural system
anybody who lives monagamous relationship not after
order ensure propogation the every man should impregnate
many women
noted lack mating abstinence
really destructive the worst
that herds only the dominate stallion when
the new dominate stallion the only one who
these seems case your system trying
shoot itself the figurative
the mating practices are something
keith
	chimps are almost
this mean that chimps have moral
chimps must have some they live social groups
they must have some dictating undesired
keith
	how you then explain sudden violent behavior human
theory would state that the more the human detached from
the more violent and the human
correct understanding was
have this bifurcation point where madman killing people

such
madmen are try explain the output from broken

gregg
	the newsgroup how about this for recognise that what
happened former communist russia has much bearing the validity
atheism has the doings sundry theists the validity their
the fallacy known and
old should the holy the book constructing
logical argument
from not making lot this there
that taught any communist what
name there clearly are theistic creeds and
how act for they all madly
with one but another
instructions how act might also
like saying since mathematics includes instructions
how atheism not moral why should
speak instructions how simply lack
belief
plenty theists

that validity
think the argument that particular theist system causes genocide

but someone correct this probably the longest
entire
that the
prophecy
fulfilled
considering the christian and judging
according its important look its claims
fulfilling earlier jewish the scribe matthew perhaps
the most eager draw out what thinks are prophetic answers
the career jesus you will main
strategy take various old testament often not even
about the promised and apply them the circumstances
the new must also bear mind the question the
authenticity the since the gospels were written
least years after jesus was not know how much
happened exactly for purposes
will take particular claims face
the
will bear and
will name him means
for will save his people from their
all this happened fulfil what the lord had
spoken
the days ahaz
king rezin syria and pekah israel made
war jerusalem but could not
quite conquer when the house david ahaz
and his court were told

refuse evil and choose the land the two kings
you dread will have been
matthew homes just the sentence that
the hebrew word
this not prophecy about the
not prophecy about event happen years
not prophecy about virgin
not about matthew has made use verse out
and tries make fit the specific case
should noted that want read the prophecy general
very general can made fit
virgin was indeed young woman with
the fit shady and has while thought
later christians walking among was never called
the christianity wished claim this prophecy
for becomes best second
class not too
after birth matthew tells about
quick elsewhere excursion
wishes liken jesus this was done escape
alleged infanticidal rampage the
remained there until the death
this was fulfil what the lord had
egypt have
what the lord really said was
when israel was loved
out egypt called the more called
them the more they went from they
kept sacrificing the and kept burning
incense
matthew conveniently omits the rest
was indeed israel once called out wanted
this jesus certainly not being spoken
are draw some kind parallel wind
with jesus that flees and resists this prophecy
just not convincing matthew probably had
rachel
while jesus off vacationing matthew says that
king herod sought kill and thus ordered the executions
all young male matthew then
that which was spoken the
prophet jeremiah was
voice was heard wailing and loud
rachel weeping for her
she refused because they were
the reference passage jeremiah referring the
carrying off israel into exile sargon
the ancestor the major tribes
and said weep for her descendants who are
since rachel lived and dies
before the hebrews were even the egyptian
interesting note that was not who
was the ancestor the judeans land where jesus and
bethlehem anyone should weeping for her
the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem
that the legends have that she was buried north the
the way
for herod and his rather unlikely
that such event actually one never but the
event not mentioned alluded anywhere else the
nor mentioned any the secular records the
herod was particularly unliked his and many far less
evil deeds herod were carefully this might
prime example how events were added life enhance
the message the
because the whole similarity the tale the
infant moses highly likely that device set
matthew add yet approval
not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects mention
the rest the jeremiah the the prophet
speaks are not but exiled the assyrian
comforts the weeping saying that the children will
will gather them back this
would not suit the children speaks are
dead for the matthew sets not even
and anyone who bothers check not too
the
not even have the next chapter find
another matthean after leaving joseph wife
take the infant jesus live the city
what was spoken the prophets
might shall called
first thing notice that matthew does not mention the name
the this have ask who
there are messianic prophecies speaking
there are mentioning still
there are nazarenes mentioned the old testament
the book angel tells mother that
she
and bear razor
shall tough his for will nazirite his
god from the day his will deliver israel
from the hands the
this course not prophecy the messiah
the best that can matthew has
begun overboard that
simple making them
bearing our
jesus next goes around healing people physical illnesses
and
this was fulfil what was spoken the
prophet took our infirmities and bore our
the verse quoted isaiah quoted out
and few words are skewed fit the christian
surely suffering has
borne our and carried our
from reading the surrounding passages know that
the prophet speaking present tense the collective nation
chosen servant and speaks the
israelites suffering the voice the gentile nations
that look upon this image deeply ingrained jewish
identity image yet israel the
instrument the salvation
the verses speak israel taking the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations guilt and
they not speak going around and
healing notice that the servant isaiah takes the
sicknesses and pains the nations individual
all did not take the diseases onto the
verses here isaiah are not prophecy something but
rather something that had already while believed
that jesus took the eternal punishment did not bear
the illnesses while someone might want say
jesus reenacted the deeds israel his
spiritual has admit that parallel
misses where intended have its
silent
upon healing multitudes said that jesus
ordered them keep presumable that arouse
the attention the local
this was fulfill what was spoken
the prophet
servant whom have
with whom soul will put spirit
and will announce justice the
will not wrangle cry nor will anyone hear
his voice the will not break bruised
reed quench smoldering wick until brings
justice and the gentiles will hope his
the isaiah passage quoted
behold servant whom
whom soul have put
spirit and will bring forth justice the
will not cry lift his
make heard the will not break
bruised quench smoldering will
faithfully bring forth will not fail
discouraged until has
established justice the and the coastlands
await his
you matthew has conveniently left out part the
because does not suit the dealings christians could
never think jesus never would the mankind
burn the servant nation israel will indeed come
end when its job when the gentiles come embrace
there will longer chosen but rather all will
the children the ending phrase has been changed
from the judaic coastlands await his the
gentiles will hope his while the
original proclaims the torah law the other rewrites
fit its strange doctrine the one
has any doubt the servant referred not one has only
read the whole isaiah and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect people robbed and
see that when attempt
three days and
three
now come upon prophecy supposedly uttered the very
mouth the god jesus speaks his crucifixion and
for jonah was the belly the
whale for three days and three will the son
man the heart the earth three days and
three
before any further discussion can necessary know
how the jews understood far day names each was
hours lasting from sunset the following sunset
what was referred was the period light from
the ending sunset according our time
sabbath day began friday and lasted until
saturday this why the jews celebrate their
sabbath the daylight portion instead
seems like real miracle that christians forget that
saturday was indeed the seventh and last day the
when days and nights are referred hour daylight
portions and hour night periods are being spoken
jesus says that will the otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three
the good book tells jesus was crucified the
which friday then was put into the
grave sometime after jesus left the
before dawn what call sunday dawn after the sabbath was
what this means that jesus using our time for
the grave from friday night some time before
sunday could also add little time before
since the bible not specific what this means
using jewish time that was the grave for one two
and possibly couple hours one certainly this
problem for jesus there absolutely way
are even able have his death involve three days and three
nights using modern time then are led
suspect that this error another one little
and that the gospel writer put false words into his
and matter who made the more
than
hearing
jesus tool habit speaking his vast audiences
stories which deeper meaning could
you were already one the those chosen understand the
message reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones the people cannot understand
there need bother with since they will not
accept the message any matthew
with them indeed
fulfilled the prophecy isaiah which
will indeed hear but never and you
will indeed but never because this
heart has grown their ears are heavy
and they have shut their eyes the they
would not perceive with her with their and
understand with their and turn for heal
the original isaiah passages are part his earlier his
call the this when israel
right before falls under the authority
isaiah sees the good times and also vision from
calling him bring reform israel and
and and say this
and but not see and
but not make the heart this
people make their ears and shut their
they will not see with their hear
with their and understand with their and
turn and then isaiah
and the cities lie waste
without and houses without and the
land utterly and the take men far
and forsaken places are many the and
though tenth will remain will burned
like terebinth oak whose stump still
stands when the tree the holy seed its
here see that really who causes the people israel
stop listening the but reaffirms the
promise made you read
the rest you find that this done fulfil the plan
use israel light the
isaiah
see that matthew has just little portion
suit his own gospel more than
has altered the make fit the people who
understand verses are
not but rather commands from the
once prophecy falls flat its
matthew tries again make parables look like they
have the prophetic
said nothing them without
this was fulfil what was spoken the
will open mouth them
will utter that which has been hidden since the
foundation the
matthew really botches attempts quote not from
but from the
will open mouth will
utter dark sayings things that all have
heard and things that our fathers have told
will not hide them from their but tell
the coming generation the glorious deeds the
was pointed the verses the psalms not really come
from you might also want know that earlier copies
gospel even inserted name this
later scribes caught the error and tried cover some
perhaps the most significant part this once
matthew has altered the old testament jesus
has said speaks parables that some will not
understand the parables the psalms are not
they speak things that our fathers have told
jesus deals with things since the foundation the
indeed jesus dealt lot secrecy and
this direct opposition the parables the
wonder matthew had rewrite and still once
artificial prophecies fall flat their
christians rarely look prophecies the
only things about christianity that are beginning look
excuses
little
see that the disciples are able
around casting out except one not knowing what
epilepsy the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with wonder that the disciples were
unable the perhaps more
enlightened than reported have rebuked saying
they have enough this seems why was this
demon seems that either true believer has faith
does enough faith will allow someone move
you will find these days that can
move real one parts the only miracles the
charismatics can speak are those rumoured happen trips
mexico some faraway major miracles are making some old
arthritis feel better sunday morning
and the including are always shrouded
ancient lore and protected from the skeptics their
sacred they are either hiding
with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles days long life goes
tales stories all distant time
distant gods used reveal themselves men the
old jehovah now they are all the
theologians give are various excuses why get see
god
too not zealous
just his put too many our
own demands had the right
were willing meet his
even the most pious men have not seen dear
have not seen not you know that
know presumptuous and searching your
you know what all that seen religions
make people feel good and content about not seeing they say
our little faith does not merit see they
the love these people you worship see the
lives people that seeing thus people get
lulled satisfied with turning into the everyday
that not seeing speaking
not seeing the way people used
what see the world that the compassion
human the love given and taken men and the
forgiveness practised christian atheist beauty created
the mind these are the things that are these are
what said this only because everybody
has little
jesus rides
shortly after accepting the role the jewish messiah
jesus requests donkey brought for him ride into
this took place fulfil what was spoken
the
tell the daughter your king
coming mounted and
the passage quoted from zechariah reads little
your king comes triumphant and
and riding
will command peace the
there all that much difference except that zechariah
only involves one animal while matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly has jesus call for
both colt and adult from get
comical picture the divine christ sweating straddle two
this could inevitably lead
proctological find that the account written
earlier only the colt was called for and brought
this indeed fits the verses zechariah and
shows that matthew attempt use prophetic has
excluding many respectable christians have
have noticed that while christ thought have ridden
the situation often reversed
entering the jerusalem the priests were
angered people and youngsters calling jesus the
jesus replied might expect matthew have
you the mouth
babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect
more likely that matthew made this response since jesus
was never one point out such little things and
might the quote which seems
fit track record quite might ask jesus
you for the source
yahweh our how majestic
your name the whole whose glory
chanted above the heavens babes and you
have founded bulwark against your foes still the
enemy and the
the passages hardly need there
spoken the and what praise there given
not his messiah and not seems
just one more case pen making convenient prophetic
yhvh said
jesus said have asked from whom the promised jewish
the jews king
then jesus counters quoting psalms
lord said sit right until
put your enemies under your
taken face jesus denying the necessity davidic
one assumes opposition their
the christian answer that but trying
make some hidden reveal some mystery about the divine
nature the tempting believe one
christian and not interested matters
there are
the psalm was thought about the
easy see why david might refer the
messiah his need only look the scriptures
about the messiah see that expected great
bringing the jews times even better than those under
the jews listening had good and the
passage could indeed refer divine such the
christians the problem lies the meaning this
error that apparently several jews time had
also one must remember that there were various factions
among the often result different expectations the
jesus was apparently one these like
his who thought the advent was and
who interpreted psalms among being
what the psalm literally
utterance
right until make your enemies your
yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from rule
the midst your your people will offer
themselves freely the day you lead your host the
holy
are priest the order melchizedek
the word often mistakenly capitalised christian
bibles denote divinity this the the
word and capitalisation adoni simply means
generic term would use used often
the scriptures refer kings and merely
address
there nothing the text itself imply that the word
refers either divinity the that this
supposed written david not the title the
psalm translates either psalm psalm about
seems fitting assume written court
about covenant and endorsement from the
psalm had been written unlikely that would
talking about the the idea perfect descended
from was not present have extensive
tales doings and none which include any
praises
many the psalms show evidence being written long after
david was times the exile when had put his show
favour for kingdom
the description the psalm fit david very david was
promised rise victory over his
successful judgement among the nations achieved
the priesthood common melchizedek being righteous
enabled bless the all
not have blame this problem matthew
there not artificial prophecy alluded though
his use the scripture rather this
event common the other gospels let matthew off
little more easily this interesting
how matthew dresses the the earlier gospel
mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking
matthew has the who became the religious competition
infant the target
might matthew writes that the event ends
embarrassing the such power the
moses
had together
all
leave the gospel story matthew momentarily see
the gospel story john
deserves special because seems far removed
from the real events career told even
for the will just look one the early
church leaders founded religion the jewish hopes messiah
and artificial extension the original promises made
when constructing the history moses wrote
promise land and nationhood the jewish while this
was accomplished under the rule king the
christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment the they expanded the
preaching about heavenly
your
rejoiced see say and was
would nice tie approval for jesus from
abraham knew nothing jesus anything
have and failed find any event the old testament
which corresponds little par for the
course see john making old testament just like
his forerunner many christians know that their faith has
many its foundations such and surprising they
still cling
the
are told that jesus was betrayed while jerusalem
one his judas matthew
and throwing down the pieces silver
the the chief
taking the lawful for
put the since blood
bought field with
bury strangers then was fulfilled what was
spoken the prophet
they took the thirty pieces the price
him whom price had been set some the
sons and they gave them for the
the lord directed
this prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament
matthew has made mistake regarding the name
the zechariah who utters the verses which
matthew makes use
they weighed out
thirty shekels then yhvh said
them the lordly price which
was paid off took the thirty shekels
silver and cast them into the treasury the house
first the verses zechariah not deal with betrayer
the the deal with most likely
chosen serve function presiding over the people
shortly before would send judah and israel into conflict with
one the had been replaced the king
james scholars with the precisely because this made
quote fit this blatant the
correct translation the hebrew indeed which also
makes perfect sense whereas
totally whether the mistranslation was
intentional not seems beyond given
track one finds hard resist the notion
intentional
matthew would have ample reason for altering the
the thirty pieces silver match and
most christians seem the reader willing disregard
the contextual matthew might have another prophecy
toss the correct translation zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high
the high priests would not put the money the
the worthless shepherd zechariah does exactly the
the average bible
the presented matthew would taken new
testament face work convincing
casting
jesus led away
gave him vinegar
mingled with but when tasted would not
drink when they had crucified they
divided his garments among them casting that
might fulfilled what was spoken the
parted garments among and upon
vesture did they cast
first the vinegar offered jesus actually common sour
the type that roman soldiers drank find
that right before jesus the soldiers themselves give him
some drink polluted with
bowl
vinegar stood they put sponge full the
vinegar hyssop and held his when
had received the
matthew seems drawing not passage from the
but one from the
looked for but there was
and for but found they gave
poison for food they put gall and
for they gave vinegar add
them punishment upon may they have
acquittal from let them blotted out the
book the
the sour wine offered jesus done his request
this does indeed seem show the psalm
quoted about david and his political and military
not about the messiah then not surprising that
run into further problem when see that the the
psalm asks for the damnation the whereas the
jesus the gospels
jesus forgive the
know what they
matthew misses with his attempt create prophecy
having gall bitter put into not his
the psalm
with the the vinegar naturally
the casting this brings the
which deserves discussion all suffice now
say that the fact that clothes were divided told
great turns out that this happened often any felon
those will soon perhaps the least
erroneous passage the psalm when applied does
indeed bring the interesting question the quality
for man removed from worldly
his ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises some
the
this psalm attributed lament his
condition under the attack his becomes song
praise yhvh and taken out parts
seem fit the plight jesus the crucifixion quite
will examine the primary
verse why have you forsaken
why are you far from helping far from the words
cry but you
and but find
jesus said have cried the first sentence while the
this suggests that the whole psalm really about rather
than king the rest the first stanza does not
fit nicely jesus his jesus not pictured
complaining about the whole supposed like
lamb led mute before its jesus much
even when the certainly does not cry
both day and night the
and scorned
all who see mock they make faces and wag
their committed his cause let
him deliver for delights
this seems fit execution pretty with the
exception the holy messiah being called
many bulls encompass they open their
mouths widely like ravening and roaring
dogs are round about company
evildoers they have pierced hands and
can see all they divide
garments among and cast lost for
but not far
soul from the life from the power the
save from the mouth the and
afflicted soul from the horns the wild
would seem quite and sure the early christian
fathers who wrote this prophecy thought
this prophecy has fatal the words really
not exist the the correct hebrew translation
dogs are round about company
evildoers encircles like the they are
hands and
hebrew the phrase the and very rare verb form
which can mean differ one phonetic the
word the hebrew text the
which makes sense the and even further fits the animal
imagery employed the psalm convenience that
would urge christian change the word
add the needed weight the this
just what the christian translators have chosen while the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring
its absence does not say much for the honesty the
apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend
itself jesus verse speaks the sufferer being
saved from sword rather than this naturally fits the
true king side now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the the but rather
the this say much favour the traditional
thought resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars
his but facts bound our religious
matthew escapes culpability this does not
attempt draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
but the like many was the minds all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations life and how much these
scriptures may have contributed what actually got written down
question that has serious repercussions for christian
easy for those who are not faithful
how some the events the new testament might
have been scribes such the eager
does less speculate than simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic this has not said good
things for
the reference the piercing looks lot like
gospel written about years after
the tells
but one the soldiers pierced his
side with and out came blood and
these things took place that scripture
will look him whom
this built passage taken blatantly out
prophet zechariah tells how much the nation
israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and war with
and yhvh will give victory
and that will seek destroy the nations
that come against jerusalem and will
pour spirit compassion and
jerusalem that when they look him who they have
they will and weep bitterly over him
like you weep over firstborn
attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker that
usually excontexts more
than just one errors are grossly obvious and
blatant does not speak well for any the gospel
helps show how the prophetic aspects their
religion were
reckoned with
after his jesus quickly executed for claiming
the jewish according one version
the gospel jesus gets executed along with two
and with him they crucified two
one his one his and the
scripture was fulfilled which
was reckoned with the
mark trying link jesus passage isaiah
about the servant nation the passage not about the
for one reads the whole chapter isaiah and its
surrounding one sees that the servant the
verses are also about what this servant has gone through the
not prediction what any the
servant thought this also happens fit the
description had the passage really been about the
still not all clear why executing jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the jesus would
more fittingly fulfill with his whole was
considered blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
locking onto single event rather poor way
steal least this see that mark could
have had made better analogy with general
mark goes tell how who were crucified with
also reviled this expected from
couple course his later luke
decides change some luke tells
and one the criminals who was hanged
with him you the save
and
this certainly fits with which tells how the
people who crucified jesus and that the
robbers did the but then luke goes
but the other rebuked
you fear since you are under the same
sentence and indeed justly
for are receiving the due reward for our
this man has done nothing and
remember when you come your
and jesus say today you
will with
this little dialogue seems highly stretches
the imagination bit see this picture one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent have rather
strange picture criminal lamenting over the goodness his
punishment and the justness his such
apparently noble and seem likely have
been wonder the amount theatrics created
recount also disagrees with
luke has only one criminal revile not easy
enough discount the discrepancy because the account was made
but those who wish believe all part the error free
words not have this avenue this yet another
example writer trying take old testament passage and
expand and reinterpret suit his this
the embroidery creates some embarrassing have
the end the
now comes perhaps one the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages the new found all
three the synoptic gospel and casts some the most
unfavourable doubt the whole theory jesus
mentions the destruction the jewish temples and and
his disciples ask him about and about the end the world
which has been warning
the tell when will this
and what will the sign your
and the close the
take care that one leads you for
many will come the
will hear wars and rumours for
this must take but the end not
nation will rise against all this but the
beginning the
they will deliver you put you
and false prophets will arise and lead many
who endures the end will this
gospel will preached throughout the whole
testimony the and then the end will
when you see the desolation spoken the
prophet those who are judea flee
the
immediately after the tribulation those
the sun will the stars will fall from
then will appear the sign the son man
and all the tribes the earth will
and see the son man and will send out
his and gather his
learn the lesson the fig soon its
branch becomes tender and puts forth you know
that summer when you see all these
you will know that the very
truly say this generation will not
pass away until all these things take
the day and one not the
not the but only the
you also must for the son man coming
hour you not
from clear that jesus thought the world would
within the lifetimes least some his tells
them that although know the exact day that
will and thus they must theologians have wet
their pants panic find some way out this holy
jesus made himself told his
disciples that their generation would still around the
and that they particular should prepare for prepare
swept
there have been some who resorted removing the inerrant

the becomes abundantly clear from

three days and three three periods three
eternal seconds three whatever they can decide makes for
less was seen glowing with divine
then the saviour decided the best
interests his new religion stick and therefore
disappeared from sight into the story
has been there were many things attributed jesus when
people got around writing the gospel stories
jesus was the fulfiller all prophecy and have
that this matter quite throughout
church christians have held fast simple
what doctrinal objections could not solved with
argumentation brute faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question and investigate has never been the
easiest way treat thus for the
prophecies cited the new testament have gone largely
things may well continue that way for some
pausing moment consider the way the doctrines christianity
have been accepted and used support
wars and suppose there one prophecy which
christianity can securely keep

	many contridictions you want
claim something general then disprove
guess have show that was not general
going claim then you prove
provided examples show that the trend was and you
have provided some mostly ones surrounding
mating think that these few cases are enough
disprove the general trend natural the mating
practices need
find
excluding from your

some
think that the natural system can objectively deduced with the
species propogation not equating the two
you that objective system necessarily the
you are you not the man who
natural moral system the objective moral system that most animals
while the natural system all objective systems
are not the natural the terms can not the natural
system subset the objective
since homosexuality has been observed most animals
and are you going claim that have
capacity being
claim that homosexuality although
helpful either the mating when you say that
homosexuality observed the animal you mean
determine what end should
you claiming usually implies more than one
this standard read any the forms are used
saying that these goals are not that why they must
because there not really way determine them
could argued that they arise from the natural
they are somewhat
the goals themselves
can create theory with postulate that the sun revolves around the
that the moon actually made green and the stars are
portions angels that intrudes into
you but such would contradict
can build mathematical proof with postulate that given the length
one side the length second side the and
degree angle connecting can determine the length the
but postulate something that generally found
think your postulate would
which one people are going more receptive order assume
about your you have able show that your postulates

they are they not good

did make such statements then should have made clear rather

	then what would have with the you theists
cannot understand that inside the universe and outside the universe
are two different put god outside the universe and you
subtract from the ability interact with the inside the
put inside the universe and you impose the rules
physics
god outside the
things outside the universe not have ability interact
with the inside the
therefore god cannot interact inside the
has basis you seem have positive knowledge
corrallary
the negation would contridict
although not have complete model the physical rules
governing the inside the expect that there are
contradictory events likely destroy the fabric modern
the other your notion omniscient and
infinitely benevolent not subject physical you
attempt explain this away describing being outside
beyond beyond measurement means can
have measurable effect cannot
your god
god beyond
beyond measurement means can have measurable effect
therefore god cannot have measurable effect
has basis
corrallary
the negation would contradict
and the angels not have
they what god tells them
	contradictory cannot
property correct this
things defined contradictory language not exist
need correct stands
will object definitions you then amend
things described contradictory language not exist
come something which plainly failures
are merely failures
you miss the point things defined contradictory language
not though something existing might conclusions
drawn from the description are unless there the possibility
find the and draw conclusions from direct knowledge
the described another possibility drop the contradictory
but that implies that one can trust the concept presented
and that one has not got doubt the source
not
neither but either things are directly sensed includes
some form the they are used
using something contradictive modelling not approved
wonder
remain with the question something contradictory can sensed
important point that either one manages
resolve the contradictions one forced not use refer
the contradictory part drawing one will fall

fact that british citizen does not preclude his being

the time writing tsv and the time the fatwa
was born muslim fairly certain then
until explicitly renounces far know has never
renounced though may have been extreme doubt
the existence being muslim legal well
according
put simply not not
accept the charge because have never adult life
affirmed any and what one has not affirmed one can not
said have apostasized the islam know states clearly that

think the rushdie affair has discredited islam more eyes than
know there are fanatics and fringe elements all
but even apparently muslims have participated
distance themselves from the against
think this but there motivations are quite
the the fact the matter that rushdie made
statements but where the line between fact
about the life
only functional illiterate with absolutely conception the
nature the novel could think such accept
from mobs but not from what
presented the fictional dream demented character cannot the
wildest stretch the imagination considered reflection the
actual the novel present the
character any worse light than secular histories
there misrepresentation his
life that his
why
people rush his defense considered absolute fool for
writings satanic
hold considered apostate and
not for his writing satanic but for
what people have accepted propagandistic version what
contained that have yet find single who
has convinced that they have read the some have initially
claimed have done but none has shown more knowledge the book
than superficial newsweek story might and all have made
factual misstatements about events the
you wish understand the
behind this well has the origin the concept
see the
paperback rafiq zakariyah called and the
keep eye out for have suggest
that you see the viking hardcover salman rushdie called
satanic perhaps then
these are for nominal they can
	the earth evil because satan rules over
this new one guess been while since witness
bothered with are they implying that satan you
might try tricking them into saying that satan and
then use that statement show them how their beliefs are
satan not but does hold dominion over the earth
according christian theology not confused with
what are the standard theologies created
and
orthodox christian theology states that god created lucifer
along with the other presumably because wanted beings
celebrate existence and life along with
actually the whys and wherefores motivations for
creating the angels are not big issue within christian
but god created lucifer with perfect nature and gave him along with
the other angels free moral lucifer was high angel
the with great seems that his greatness caused
him begin take pride himself and desire equal
greater than forgot his place created exalted
himself above and thereby evil and sin entered
the story goes that lucifer refused bow before man
god commanded him lucifer was devoted

	there has been some discussion the pros and cons about sex outside
where the evidence for the there are just
generalities can for read that the
the percentage youth people who suffer from
depression has been steadily climbing western societies
what was reading referred particularly the one
can detect trend towards greater occurrence sex outside marriage
this century western societies particularly with the
the but even before that think the
the would not have been
particularly with the gradual weakening christianity and consequently
christian moral teachings against sex outside propose
that these two trends greater level general depression society
other psychological and greater sexual promiscuity are
with the latter being prime cause the cannot
provide any evidence beyond this this but the whole thesis
seems very reasonable and request that people ponder upon
fred rice giving his point
think this big leap one example
where seriously promiscuity
depression not and might more reasonable say
think depression more likely come
from emotional problems and
promiscuity used
since see marriage civil and religious bond rather than
emotional see problem with sex before outside
marriage long you have the same commitment and devotion
what expected from married this just

	what about that revelation
talking about this intellectual engagement
obviously risk one
not but does madness qualify
intellectual
people say that the concept metaphysical and religious knowledge
not not particularly impressed with problems
the problem this case least bad that
explain quantum mechanics and relativity the terms ordinary
one can get some rough but the language from
perspective ordinary and from the
being rather inexact
exactly why science uses representation natural language
not supposed replace the elaborate representation mathematical
nor supposed the opposed the
representation gods religions ordinary
not every religion says but fancy side effect their inept
representations are the eternal hassles between
and allows for making experiments that will lead results that will
agreed upon being show something similar
analogous situation obtains the problem
the descriptive language not
with the effect that the models presented are and one can argue
that the other way namely that the only reason metaphysics still
flourish because makes statements that can verified falsified
showing that
case holds reliable can you show how you establish
word essentially meaningless the unless you
show how reliability can
you read the many posts about what reliability and how can
acheived respectively

british around blowing skyscrapers
know you are doing but seems you are implying
that the person accused blowing the wtc actually did
that islamic teachings have something with blowing the
world trade which was the building that was blown
make some
the person has only been accused innocent until proven
there seem some holes his accusation that
read for they guy used that particular van
the and then back and claim his deposit back
must incredibly
salamen was one those muslims hear much
was
smart enough put together very sophisticated
seem fit
salameh was not the only person the other fellow was
chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied
devices school not actually allow radical
types study things like this our universities much for
price
from what the other fellow told salameh how put together
over the the bomb was supposedly some sort sophisticated
put assume sophisticated bomb together
from instructions the one must need some brains would
there have
been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims the
states consequence his have
now please tell where this live the and
have heard very little about these mosque there are many mosques
texas and would like know what going can verify
the great jewish media conspiracy keeping from knowing about
the heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm
why quiet maybe localized new
read this article australian muslim the
newspaper the australian muslim
this perhaps one the muslims based north america
they see this can
islamic teachings teach against harming the the
explicitly teaches against harming innocents even times
blowing the wtc and harming innocents therefore blatant
islamic
means absolutely plenty people commit violence while
what they think are valid religious have seen
post many things here from the koran which could
that the explanation you wish muslim
them harm idolators and the first thing every muslim
that muslim could have done that because islam teaches against
and are supposed take you word that never
what you think the does allah strike them
before the violence course muslims commit
violent act and then everyone hides behind verses the
hip that and even doubt that will come the
defense that muslim and islam teaches not harm the
the people who were killed must not have been sure
off the your but you must
allah would not have allowed are you insulting
admit that there are some incredibly violent muslims the
and stop hiding from that does one any good deny
only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the
can you see
deny this
the thrust argument here that
salameh according innocent has not been found
guilty court his guilt has not been
wrong for people make postings based this
islam teaches harm muslims who perhaps
have not realized that islam teaches this perform such
the teachings but rather spite and
contradiction the teachings this important
should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say
anyone who calls themselves and does not
outwardly profess
something clear contradiction with the essential teachings islam
considered one who might things contrary
islam for does not suddenly become
one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential
then one does leave
the term contrasted with which means
whether muslim reality
something known only god perhaps that person you
will not find the term used very much muslims
because not known anybody myself and whether
for for could just
putting show and reality believe something opposite
what write without anyone when say
mean all those who outwardly profess follow whether
practice they transgress islamic
not necessarily mean

atheists that come across who fit into the
that you
you have taken umbrage statements the effect that and
reason are all have and when you have implied
that have alternative called have repeatedly
asked you explain what revelation and how one can both
experience and interpret revelation without doing via our senses
and you failed please
can you explain what revelation and how one can
experience and interpret without using senses and inherent
here the context for the
not and have then
not all
show that revelation revelation not
through the how exactly according
revelation act revealing communicating
tell how such thing can
other than via the tell how you can interpret
revelation other than with that using your brain
what you are when say there way for
being interface with the universe other than via the senses
reason because this the simple
you have another mechanism all
with
then
cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe
senses and our
this
simple challenge you show
then
mystics will agree this and the common defense
absorb mystical experiences
the question whether some senses are better than
allow you the broadest definition make things easier
show that
allowed testimony others since
have dismissed testimony unreliable you tainted
own once these mystical thingies are show
evidence that human can recognize and respond them short
via that reasoning
challenge you show these you cannot you
well give the
then
you have not explained your interpretation your
not possible for have attacked
specifically challenged you explain this
stuff that you were talking and note for the
that you appear have declined
and
does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit
our senses and reasoning you have answered none
questions that straight the heart your you
answer your claims are entirely
you have stated that all claims dispassionate analysis made
posters are unverifiable and asked you identify
one such claim that have you have failed please
have made any claims all that are unverifiable and
please repeat
here the context for the
must thank david wood most sensitive and intelligent wrong
then
the reference fantastical
represents fairly accurately reaction all the claims
analysis that are repeated this
your address and pleased send you
can you name one claim that have made that any
unverifiable demand that you retract this
you cannot offer you follow your usual
ignoring the then you are simply
first you dismissed claims atheists that they became atheists
result then later you stated that one accepted the
reason that one help but become asked
you explain the your only response was statement
that the question was opinion not shared others that
have they atheist you have failed answer
the please
you retract your claim that posters have not become
atheists result despite their testimony that
you retract that you retract the
subsequent claim that acceptance the axioms reason inevitably
result
here the context for the
have here bunch people who claim that their position
atheists prove
not see how one can accept these axioms and not end with
atheistic point
you claimed that you would not answer these
challenges because they contained too much the way
from previous you implied that you
respond because was putting words your please clarify
this seeming
you prefer respond challenges that include context
from your own that paraphrase your positions order
avoid
here the context for the
first you
ordinary rules are that read articles over over lines
articles which there nothing but included text the first
these are not rules but
then
someone not going argue with version then
cannot argued
your responses are awaited with
wood
for the below compilation responses
these challenges
makes sense gives the appearance either utter
answering some question
not subscribe the opinion that gauntlet thrown down
net requires any response some point might read and
your and then might ordinary rules are
read articles over over lines articles which there
but included text the first these are not rules
but
left out something else respond
list things avoid are arguments about the arguments
some call
have start saying not what and the response
reason someone not going argue

	think objective morality does but that most flavors morality
only approximations once natural objective morality
fairly easily long you have goal what
the purpose this
not quite getting what you mean but think objective
any oriented
like this subjective get how using
word
the goal need not subjective for the goal
natural morality the propogation
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
this were intelligent animals have different needs than

complicated than law the think that

	have request for those who would like see charley wingate
respond the judging from there
appear quite few
clear that wingate intends continue post tangential
unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges between
the last two the noted perhaps dozen
more posts none which answered single
seems unmistakable that wingate hopes that the questions
will just and doing his level best change the
given that this seems rather common
would like suggest that impress upon him our desire for
the following
ignore any future articles wingate that not address the
until answers them explictly announces that
refuses
you must respond one his include within
something similar the
answer the questions posed you the charley
not looking humiliate anyone just want some
honest you think that honesty would too much
ask from devout would
that was rhetorical
wood
	you are presenting see how this argument
leads any firm the material john not sure
what referred but take for granted the similarity
the one could have almost
relationship between the right john getting straight from
the argument says john has known codified version the
and not the assuming that there has been has
like that john might have known the yet rather referred
his that the logia were given codified version
the first
the argument alone does not allow firm but fits well into
the dating usually given for the
are talking date texts not the age the the usual
for the time order matthew and luke does not consider
respective says matthew has read the text and luke
matthew probably that
version the have heard has matthew and luke
relying mark and one would think that luke relied
have the grating inconsistencies the
one
not luke may have trusted the version knew better than the
version given improving matthew would give for
far the theory that luke has known matthew based
statistical analysis the
assumed that john knew the content the evidence
that not
the part that particularly new were possible that
could point
but will take another day get the hope your german
good
got the info was the late
early and was possibly old
they are from about why they shed doubt the order
john after the rest the
closes the gap between writing and the existing
quit the further away from the the more copies can
and therefore survival becomes more
still not see how copies from allow change the dating
john was disciple not generally the style and language
with the theology are usually used
not really impressed with the but really
this out and pointed out one cannot make
arguments about see reason not accept
but gives only possibilities and the authencity
many letters still looks conclusions about them are not
drawn because some pet dogmas the churches would probably fall with them
step and one generation removed bad even our compare that
reports similar events our century almost illiterate
best analogy would reporters talking the which
rather like some newsletter political party reporting from the
big not necessarily but certainly
other one does not know what the original mark did look like
arguments based mark are pretty
the statement divinity not that and any
that the most important epistles predate
but the accuracy their tradition another
are there letters not from paul and predating mark claiming the
divinity
benedikt
	will argue that your latter believe that gods
rest upon faith that you are making positive statement
gods rather than merely saying
and therefore believe them and not believe then
once not believe god different than
believe that god does not still maintain the
even after reading the that strong atheism requires
the way usually you are saying here
that driving car requires faith that the car
not saying this all requires faith part
say the car drives because seen drive done more
than fact actually driven what does require
some faith the belief that senses give accurate representation
out but there evidence pro con
for the existence god what have
say below
for and have more faith than
have the premises and the argument
sorry remain skeptical believe entirely
that you have seen evidence that there god
correct neither have but lack evidence for the existence
something way evidence for the something
creationist have similar mode argumentation which they
disprove evolution the establish you have never
seen neutrino but they the analogy breaks
down and rather have scientific theory that explains the
appearance animal life when draw the conclusion that
exist because seen this conclusion
has foundation observation and
did would qualitatively similar other known
that since there good evidence that all life earth has
evolved from ancestors these pink unicorns would share
common anscestory with horses and zebras and
has such correspondence with anything there physical
frame work observation draw any conclusions
first let say the
might have language problem here regards and
maintain that god does not
exist means have being space and god does not have
god kierkegaard once said that god does not
with this feel rather pointless
debate the called god and that not what
doing believe that god the source and ground
when you say that does not also accept this
but obviously mean two different things
what follows will use the phrase existence
and this the sense that think you are using
would like clarification upon what you mean existence
word
disagree with you profoundly defined god
existence defined but this might
getting off the subject although you think relevant
can come back
saying god existence either waste existence
already used and there need replace you are
implying more with which case your definition and your argument
far are making
you are using wrong categories here perhaps you misunderstand
what making argument what ever and offering
definition there not trying convince you
believe and that rests upon and inappropriate
apply the category logic this realm someone tells you
that they can logically prove god that they have
then the use logic disprove their claims fine and
incomplete argument not fallacy some things are not
even
can never prove that god does does not when you say
you believe god does not and that this opinion
upon will have ask observtions are
refering there are observations pro con that
valid here establishing positive
where does that observations based the assumption
that something
follow you certainly one can make observations
things that they know still maintain that one
cannot use observation infer that does not such
positive assertion requires
and you say there level definition that the assumption
would reject that concept
where your evidence for that meaningful some
once again you seem completely misunderstand have
evidence that any maybe such
response you gave just comes naturally you because
many people try run their own private conception god down
your not doing arguing and
only thing that make positive assertion about something
for which there can principle evidence for against
requires leap requires you would
there form atheism that can respect
but must founded upon

began with questioning the historical acuuracy

validate secular history that are used here discredit
then virtually nothing known the first

has nothing with merely another statement

	worry about the one case where innocent man
something horrible enough warrant the death and
put laws into place which make virtually impossible actually
real then the death penalty not serving its original
should either changed done away
have numbers back this take the following
you use number innocent people
sentenced die acceptable loss for the benefit capital
very surprised the ratio were that
there have been approximately dozen known cases the
execution the innocent the since the turn the
have that same period sentenced people
accounting for those cases that know the seems
reasonable assume that twice that many innocent people have
fact been that would raise the number death
sentences metered out since half million for your
acceptance ratio rather doubt the
the what acceptable
seems probably not doing even that
should perhaps find better
any suggestions what better solution might realize the
nature the numbers and answer what
acceptable loss rate said another
despise the idea supporting criminals for the economics
the situation that concern the money spent
housing and taking care people who have demonstrated that they are

and probably would consider far more worthwhile and which

into godhood for the purpose off throwing the yoke roman
reasons why liar are who would
for
are the moslem fanatics who strap bombs their backs and driving into
jewish embassies dying for the truth they think they were the
nazi soldiers wwii dying for the
people die for lies all the
people able tell was people
was hitler how about ronald spend
millions dollars year trying find techniques detect the
answer they able tell was liar only lied
about some
around him and kept doing many gathered from hearing seeing
who was had been call but believe did
why you think healed because the bible says but god
exist other then the bible not divinely
inspired and one use piece was written
unbiased
was would more than entire nation drawn
someone who was very fact for example
were hitler mussolini how about genghis jim
there are thousands examples through history people being drawn
who drawn david koresh obviously logical people see
right
since liar must have been the
obviously cannot rule out liar lunatic not mention all the other
possibilities not given this
other things fulfilled loads prophecies
isaiah and elsewhere hrs this his betrayal
possibly prophecy was aware what should
order fulfil these possibly selective diting behalf
those keepers the holy bible for thousand years before the
public had possibly also that the text written such
riddles that anything that happens can twisted fit
the words raving fictional
have bible with this next time
will use
about how hard christian

	you are saying that possible for instinctive act
moral
like think that many things are explain
instinctive acts can moral and happy
for were instinctive not
then not murdering would have moral since there
would nothing voluntary about
order for act act
person must consider the immoral action but then disregard
than there must the possibility that the
not just people are talking about can
only intelligent beings can even the bahavior other
beings mimics
you are starting get the mimicry not necessarily the
same the action being parrot saying
necessarily commenting the pulchritude
how much emphasis you place
see
animals the same species could kill each other but
they
they and other posters have given you many examples exactly
but you seem have very short
are you trying say that this act morality because
most animals intelligent enough think like
must the possibility that the organism not
just people are talking about can consider
right there the posting you are replying
	act morally for particular then what
morality most
that morality instinctive animals attempt
your
conclusion correct err that the behaviour which
animals moral
are disagreeing the definition moral you said
that must conscious your instinctive
behavior pattern could act you are trying apply
human terms think that even someone not conscious
this does not prevent his behavior from being
think that morality behavior what human
moral action one that consistent with given
that enforce certain behavior
keep getting this are trying show that
behaviour pattern whether morality behavior
since there can behavior for
the motions the that most people would
call
try show but your
morality can thought large class could
defined terms many laws physics you
seems silly talk planet because obeys the laws
less silly talk about they have least

	whole thread started because discussion about whether
not the death penalty constituted cruel which forbidden
the
but they say what they meant which why
you have the supreme and makes sense refer
the which quite silent the meaning the
they spent quite bit time the wording the they
picked words whose meanings implied the have already looked
the dictionary define the this
but were discussing the death penalty that discussion
from the one about murder which resulted from intial
about objective this already three times
from the morality
were discussing the mening the word and
constitution says nothing about
but were discussing relation the death the
constitution need not define each the words anyone who
know what cruel can look the dictionary
keith
	just what you thought the theory while all humans
generally capable overpowering their does not
that those who this often are necessarily more
why animals capable overpowering their
good sure some biologist could answer better than
but animals brains are just set
animals but instincts serve them there
reason contradict
keith
	expect the lion not know anything the
have any evidence that lions ever consider such
why think you can assign moral
the instinctive behaviour
what been saying that moral behavior likely the null
that take much work but certainly does
immoral some
the craziest thing ever are you
take much work
said that morality remnant
and why people discuss morality daily
because kind evolutionary like your little
our moral system based concepts well practiced the animal
this must some novel use the phrase with which
not sufficiently what you mean and
what the significance for your
you are basically saying that you think undefinable
and that agree
these then how can hope discuss
perfectly clear that saying that know what moral
but that speak for other
this get your particular beliefs are irrelevant
unless you can share them discuss
what would you like know about particular moral
you raise topic never quite happy
invent moral belief out thin

lying about swing sacred cow without slammin into
peaceful joshua and the jawbone ass spring
agree with bobby this religion used kill large numbers
people usually not used the form manner that was originally
intended
that reduce the number deaths directly caused
just minor observation the fact that there almost nothing pure
the the very act honestly attempting find true meaning
religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led many
people have been led religious leaders more involved their own
any absolute and have therefore been driven
kill their
the point that there are many things involved religion that often
lead whether these things are part unpleasant
side effect bobby would have the result people switching
between religion and atheism the results are the
the other hand are typically not ideological
social nor are they driven organize and spread their
the overuse nazism and stalinism just show how true this two groups
with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution
further their anyone who cannot see the obvious namely that these
were groups founded for reasons their who used religious
persecution not because any belief system but because made them more
powerfull trying too bobby uses these examples
because there are few wars that were fought over
religion that does not have many

	want know how this omniscient being going perform
feat terming actions right
you were know who exactly did and with what
purpose with particular goal you sould
able methodically judge whether not this action was accordance
with the general
but now you are contradicting yourself pretty massive
and think even
another part this been telling that the
natural morality what animals
but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
term survival humanity requires exterminate some
other either terrestrial
does that make moral
	they may fall back other but this one they
not have available
worse than the national should changed
bless the list goes
maybe but definately violation the
rules the supposedly maybe the others
should changed but not personally concerned
about the anthem since come across daily
nearly unavoidable
and tempted rub that motto the
christians when debunking their standard motto slinging
better than the people you
despise the their meant
when chatting with the ones who refuse listen any idea
other than their just becomes exercise for
the motto would have
godlessness
you approve such
unless the only way get rid the current one
was change such
	act morally for particular then what
morality most
that morality instinctive animals attempt
your
conclusion correct err that the behaviour which
animals moral
are disagreeing the definition moral you said
that must conscious your instinctive
behavior pattern could act you are trying apply
human terms
pardon trying apply human terms
think there must some confusion the guy who
saying that animal behaviour instinctive then does
have any moral how does refusing apply human
terms animals get turned into applying human
think that even someone not conscious
this does not prevent his behavior from being
sure you think you say how about trying
convince
think that morality behavior what human
moral action one that consistent with given
that enforce certain behavior
keep getting this are trying show that
behaviour pattern whether morality behavior
since there can behavior for
the motions the that most people would
call
try show but your
four accept your definition
you allow ascribe moral significence the orbital motion
the
morality can thought large class could
defined terms many laws physics you
seems silly talk planet because obeys the laws
less silly talk about they have least
some free
the law and what livesey finds
intuitive but what schneider finds intuitive
now devastating
	seeing you are not muslim the sort fatwa issued khomeini
not relevant can understand your fear persecution
share even more than you however
was not completely
much considered some the dialogue
here total waste somehow restrain myself this
try
come senses and accept the
wisdom and power the quran and not only but allah
himself drops congratulate wise allah rolls
few bones and get then allah gets out the bends
and invites take spin around the
realize that maybe allah looking for more
commitment than ready say got some
programming gotta call
thinking renounce
allah said still thinks
jim
	religions have been replaced systems
value human rights
secular laws seem value criminal life more than the victims
islam places the rights society and every member above
the rights the this what call true human
the you actually support the claim precedence islamic
case you what about the laws other
muslim living land bound the laws the land
live but not disregard islamic law still remains part
the laws land conflict with religion such extent
that prevented from being allowed practise religion then must
leave the way islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but are instructed follow the laws the land that live
islamic state ruled religions other than islam
are allowed rule their own religious laws provided they affect
the genral population and come into direct conflict with state
dhimmis are exempt from most islamic laws
such fighting giving zakat
etc but are given the benefit these two acts such military
protection and they are poor they will receive
what has got with and has anyone reliable
left islam according islamic
the burden proof
benedikt
after the fatwa rushdie his faith
very public binding
himself islamic has publicly renounce his belief islam
the burden

	this all sounds everyone helping each other and always smiling
fluffy bunnies wake people are just not like
evident from history that society has succeeded when had rely
the goodwill and unselfishness the obvious from
like iran that even there are only few greedy people society
they are going attracted positions sounds like
for
give you example
father recently bought the business price was pounds
and father approached the people the community for raised
pounds interest free loans from friends and relatives and
muslims had cash and the rest got business after
paying off the muslim lenders many them helped him with further loans
help him clear the bank debt and save him from further this
example muslim community helping one why did they help
because their common identity turn father has helped
with people buying houses minimise the amount intrest they pay
and some cases buy houses intrest free with the help those more
fortunate the
the fact leonard does work without fluffy bunny

	they may fall back other but this one they
not have available
worse than
maybe but definately violation the
the supposedly
the motto would have
godlessness
you approve such
unless the only way get rid the current one
change such
what wrong with you approve
even that beginning think that you just have something
against mottos what you think plurbis
keith
	above were reference people
that there were similar things but one could name
not gave you two one was the rather
german christianity well before hitler
the other was the system social ranks that were used
imperail germany and austria distinguish jews from the rest
the
these seem like they are orders
worse than the you think that the motto
that will lead worse
keith
	instinctive acts can moral and happy
were instinctive not
not murdering would have moral since there
nothing voluntary about
there you saying that moral act only significant
why you think
and humans have the ability disregard some their
only intelligent beings can even the bahavior other
mimics
are starting get the mimicry not necessarily the
the action being parrot saying
necessarily commenting the pulchritude
you are attaching too many things the term
try that animals the same species
kill each you think this
you think that animals are and that nothing they
either right nor
the same species could kill each other but
and other posters have given you many examples exactly
but you seem have very short
those arbitrary they were slayings related some sort
mating ritual
you trying say that this act morality because
animals intelligent enough think like
must the possibility that the organism not
people are talking about can consider
right there the posting you are replying
yes but still understand your what
you mean can small child how about
where the line does
the being need self
what you call the mechanism which seems prevent animals
the same species from killing each
you find the fact that they all
keith
	another part this been telling that the
natural morality what animals
humans have gone somewhat beyond this perhaps
our goal one
suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
survival humanity requires exterminate some
either terrestrial
now you are letting omniscient being give information this
was not part the original
that make moral
which type morality are you talking natural
not all immoral harm another species long

	want start right out and say that
sense have any you read tony
the real might little off the but
the anyway was part effort destroy
the process became christian
assume you are posting encourage comments how much history has
tony campello not much
arguements uses summing the book about whether
was god know many you but listen
perspective for all have something gain listening what
have
good hear that there are few reasonable christians
only those christian would take
australia there very strong bunch christian
scientists who believe that every single event the bible exactly
and that there rational explanation for all that can justified
using the laws for there are few chaps who are
trying prove that the age the universe years and that the
error conventional calculations the result the fact that the speed
light has been rapidly decaying over the and this has not been
accounted
book says that jesus was either was crazy
day was actually who said
that never and the bible was and was never
intended become manifesto for billion did tony follow that one
reasons why liar are who would
for people able tell was people
around him and kept doing many gathered from hearing seeing
who was had been
millions people have for this point difficult
substantiate since not well defined great many religious arguments
work that but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed
themselves their gods the belief that this act would bring them victory
the spanish the list the aztecs
but believe did heal
that perfectly but not grounds for
become more the does not add weight
the claim that jesus was the
was would more than entire nation drawn
someone who was very fact for example
who drawn david koresh obviously logical people see
right
have you ever seen documentary about the rise nazi more the
did tony mention one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his
many colleagues illogical their support hitler was based
upon emotional issue rather than rational agreement with
his obviously argument invalid tony thought that hitler
was
since liar must have been the
think his arguments warrant the use
other things fulfilled loads prophecies
isaiah and elsewhere hrs this his betrayal
have bible with this next time
will use
this what alot religious discussions have had with
people result quoting the the only reasonable way think
people can look the bible treat the stories some sort
metaphorical representation the messages that the authors were trying
someone tries interpret parts the bible
she will end all sorts
argument would perfectly reasonable for people who believe
the events described the bible took but convince
who thinks the bible total that jesus real quoting the
book totally for mathematics you cannot say
equal because equal
think most people understand what christian
that would possibly explain why there have many people being killed
religious and why there are hundreds different versions all
claiming
certainly not what see lot rather think
way and total sacrafice everything for
loved enough die and save should the
hey god himself inspires turn our lives
tuff and most people want
christian would something for the strong persevere but
like weight lifting guitar whatever takes
rush one christianity your whole

about science was was far more impressed that the
did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced
how would man century arabia have known
the holy had authored
short the writer quran decided stay away from
you not open your then you put you foot into
your mouth
but then you say quran does not talk much about then one can
not make claims bobby that you have great science

how would man century arabia have known

this book worth read get sensible view this
the book two section contains fairly reasonable
analysis the showing many inconsistencies between the bible
and modern well all know
section analyses the version the old testament
and the face present good case showing the koran
consistent with modern was plain that
this consistency was only possible the vague phraseology the
take the for the bible full
days and forty every all
know this the description the same event
obscure make possible interpretation such big river
flooded for few days and caused much contradiction
but also not much
the koran might consistent with modern but being
consistent due its vagueness compared with other books that
does not seem much
the book concludes saying something the koran must have had
divine inspiration because the time was written there were lot
ridiculous ideas about the and none them
can found the arguing for the greatness book
talking about what does not contain seems absurd the
the above from memory may have missed some

	which news are talking
western news but particular the american
the general tone the news during the whole
war was one poor along with how precisely
this cruise missile blew this building
most over here there was very little about the suffering the iraqi
civilians until towards the end the and then was confined the
few remaining quality
the news media seemed entranced all the new gizmos
the military was not mention the taped video transmissions from
the missiles they zeroed their but and especially
after the bunker full civilians was they changed their
seemed that they have the stomach for the reality
that innocent people really die and are maimed like
they were only long was and
missiles dropping military but not when pictures
and maimed civilians started cropping what naive
how about all the innocent people who died
hear you bemoaning
discussion about and
all things the and the atomic bomb were
essential therefore bringing the war quick
end avoid even greater allied
should have said here seems from your
comments below that you understood this meaning
what about the evidence that america knew japan was about surrender after
hiroshima but that another lie peddled the liberal
media
have often wondered about always thought that the first bomb
should have been dropped island fortress
inpenatrable military the second bomb been held back
for use industrial center need but
have heard that found evidence the that japan
was seriously considering surrender after the first
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the
therefore the second bomb was most
for regret
nuke jap for
regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have made
which affect the lives innocent but regret the
circumstances which make those decisions and regret the
suffering caused those
why all the fuss about kuwait and not east even
iraq why were still selling them stuff couple weeks
before started
make claim effort justify the misguided foreign policy the
west before the evident that the especially
misjudged hussein but once hussein invaded kuwait and
threatened militarily corner significant portion the
oil had
can overlook his using chemical weapons thousands
but threatens your right drive huge
the gotta
was the fact that both situations existed that prompted
and allied some country took over some other
probably not that
but the coup had occured
kuwait then still have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived
saudi but the combination the unprovoked invasion
genocidal tyrant and the potential danger the oil
caused take
moved paragraph from here later
allowing hussein keep then would
have been
but did you ever hear anyone advocate such course
are you just setting
not setting strawman you want argue against the
then the only logical alternative was allow hussein keep
diplomatic including were
guess
have fought either just think all those innocent
german civilians killed dresden and
germans are human you
what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler
his grandiose quest for year the consequences
stemmed from
were asking for
they probably had idea what end hitler
would lead their nation
but what about those who support dreams
not they democratically voted for all his the nsdap got
the elections and that was the last chance the german people got
vote the
they suffered along with the why does this bother you
the world full and circumstances are not many
innocents suffer due the wrongful actions
but there are perfect
look forward hearing your incisive comments about east timor and
what should say about anything
the people east timor are still being killed dictatorship that
invaded their even western journalists have been all
this was happening before the gulf why send the bombers
east why sending the bombers
probably because not the saviors the police each
and every country that decides invade nor
are strategic position get relief east
some other
that paragraph moved
your sound like loving you
doing very good job
not very allow hussein hitler gobble
nearby countries and keep allow them continue with mass
slaughter certain peoples under their have
say stopping hussein was the most thing for the
most people involved once set his mind military
the chinese government has policy mandatory abortion and sterilization
tibetan people are rounded and amnesty
international recently reported that torture still widespread
why stopping why are actively sucking them
trading freely with
tell how could stop them and support for not
agree with the present policy you put
agree that
and for poor rodney did you ever stop and think
the jury the first trial brought back verdict
amongst the things thought were awful lot white
people that
was the trial not rodney
surely irrelevant juries are supposed represent
the
are are they supposed reflect the population the locale
where the trial this where the crime committed
unless one party the other can convince the judge change venue
not expert california even but
seems that this the way the system set you can criticize
the but not have unfounded allegations racial
prejudice thrown
and under american law they deserved jury
you are saying that black people are not the peers white
not the point that the fact that there were blacks
the first jury and that rodney king black totally
this point allegedly racial really
this idea people only being tried before jury people just like them
really should the nuremburg trials have had jury entirely made
mean who the same
like having murderers judge means people from
the same station presumably because they are better
position understand the
those who have been foaming the mouth for the blood those
policemen certainly have looked further than the video
but the jury looked the evidence which you and
have not
when see bunch policemen beating someone lying defenceless
the rather hard imagine what this other evidence might have
when has argument from incredulity
gained acceptance from the revered author logical
not talking about logical talking about court
the faq points some fallacious arguments are not viewed
fallacies court
you are using this reasoning part
logical argument this this not court
the facts the news commentators presented them are then
feel the verdict was reasonable
were you not talking earlier about the bias the liberal media
the media not totally even though there prevailing
liberal programs such the news hour try give
balanced and fair reporting the there are even conservative
sources out there you know where for
never used the word accept
more theories that there some liberal
conspiracy attempting take over all news

which case thou shalt and also kill anyone who gets the
unfortunately cannot
jim brown bible for loving christians
thanks like the pretty funny
monty python you kind seems that
oversimplifying any moral argument can make seem
but you know that
only
arguing against killing innocent
supposed are arguing that kill innocent people
long you get some guilty ones
say that good thing kill innocent people
the end live perfect world and
there are perfect one going resist then
innocent people both sides are going suffer and say
but sometimes
moral arguing that saturation bombing german cities
the end world war was far can evil and unnecessary
would agree that was evil the sense that caused much pain
and not sure that was unnecessary you that
conclusion can only arrived evaluating all the factors
and perhaps unnecessary now that
mean that those who had make the decision bomb see
being rarely can one have full known the consequences
action before making the time may have seemed
necessary enough ahead with
but assume that feel the bombing was justified
just condemn those who had make difficult
decision under difficult
having criticised moral relativism the are now arguing that
position judge the morality allied actions the end the
you certainly are not such position you are moral
position but defer
you are arguing that the actions need assessed the particular
context the and that they might have been moral then but not moral
they were neither moral then nor they seemed necessary
those making the decisions bring quick end the simply
refuse condemn them for their
your christian your absolute how quick
you are discard them when suits ivan stang would
would
one day will stand before jesus and give account every word and
even this discourse this understand the full ramifications
and prepared believe that you can make the
same
mathew
and the reason brought the germany was
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties being
yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
accurate enough hit targets
decisive way any other method that but the gulf
precision bombing was the the point why make big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
spite precision when many more civilians
and died under the blanket bombing
even with precision mistakes happen and some
civilians but less civilians suffered this war than
any other iany other many iraqi civilians went about their lives
with minimal interference from the allied air the stories
iraqi civilian dead just plain
the lost servicemen over four years
and the majority them were directly involved but
are expected swallow that
iraqis died war lasting about and with
the allies using the most precise bombs ever created
what iraqi civilians
was due actions hussein took his own not due
the allied

went back and reread your all you did attack and
that agnosticism funny nowhere does that
that you are weak most people who post
inflammatory remarks are was reasonable
did not clearly state
condescending the population large will not
many people your faith anytime only ruins your
being condescending the population stating
that happened true for long believe
people actually believed this god was alien concept
not trying win people faith you put have
religion was non issue when had the attitude above because
never even occurred atheist default guess you
the most common form condescending the rational versus irrational
once one has accepted the that there
and then consider other faiths irrational simply because their
contradict your then would say
lack consistency
now know get about the belief that god
does not exist were logical why many rational
people have problems with that
but probably like seem soft sorry for the
line about atheists haveing something their sleeves what seemed
imply been reading too much the clipper project
the paranoia over there may have seeped
what the clipper project
mix apples with how can you say that the
the mongols was worse than khan conquered
his that was but stalin killed
own people who loved and worshipped and his atheist can
worse than
rulers have done similar things the only stalin did
there was plenty documentation afix the blame the
that some the early european rulers ruled with iron
much like you threw and sick hearing
stalin example because the example you
get angry with your post because appeared attack
forms
might have appeared attack atheism but its point was
that mass killing happens for all sorts people will hate who
they will and will wave whatever flag justify cross
the stalin example important not only because
still widely unappreciated era that people want forget but also
because people really did love him and his even after all that
had
evidence referring more lack evidence than negative
say claim there are pink have never seen
pink but that mean this person
claims that there are pink even though admits
able capture one get find one with
sense that evidence not believe the existence pink
what saying when look the look the
evidence for show how and show
theists want and
all the pink arguments the world will not
sway most for they simply not accept the
one the big reasons that many people want something
beyond this you can pretend that they want but for
one can accept and even want myself
and there nothing unique this example why people want
can love truth
god principle hard see how
are necessarily
sense they seem arrogant make such claim
previous refutation still and believe there may
one the
john the baptist boasted jesus many find hard see
how that behavior arrogant many christians know also boast
this but still not necessarily see
know arrogant and teachers
you might consider the person who originally made given claim
for
you talking about all atheism just strong you are
about weak atheism which believe then refuse such
lack used good razor make the
rejection see even
the hypothesises equal find the theist argument
speak against strong also often find that the evidence
supporting faith very just the evidence supporting
love truth

since liar must have been the
might not have any number that the logical pitfall that those who
use flawed logic like this fall there are bifurcations that are because
the proceeding the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are
once everyone agrees that the given set indeed all there then arguments among
the alternatives can and one mostly likely true can deduced excluding
all other possible
can shown that the set not all then any conclusions bases the
incomplete set are even the true choice one the original have given

meant that there must have been one copy certain the time quoted
acquaintace was approximately years after the death

from this time period and all that exists today are
cutting all the crap out the way god wrote could anyone answer
the
how old the oldest surviving copy the new
there are parts scraps that date from around the
mid second century there are some complete
from the middle third the first complete collection
the new testament dates from the early century throughout
this period are writings various early church who
quoted various scriptures their
there any truth
you mean that someone discovered thousands which were all
perfect copies dating from the last part the
you mean that there are thousands early manuscripts the
dates given but not letter and that the most probable
text can reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
original autographs probably were written starting sometime
shortly after then

worked better than just like did
who even mentioned and what makes you think the situation

allowing hussein keep then would
have been precisely the lessons the world learned

nor the defense one cannot conclude either way due
the silence the
law this country intended protect the rights the
whether they criminals one not found guilty there
reasonable doubt and only the jury position
assess the evidence and render
but still finding hard imagine what the
was this the cops certainly seem beating someone
lying defenceless the your mass
orbital faked video
certainly seemed that there was excessive force
and the original verdict baffled but then
learned that the prosecution the first case did not try convict
charge excessive force simple assault which they probably
would have they tried get conviction charge aggravated
assault with intent inflict serious bodily which
news commentators was akin attempted murder under california
based what the prosecution was asking evident that
the first jury decided that the officers were
not doing but aggravated assault
with the inflicting serious bodily the seeds the
prosecutions defeat were their own overconfidence obtaining
verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they
the facts the news commentators presented them are then
feel the verdict was reasonable

they meet the other

when the first man was that time the

launch your own xtian time meeting all the

the idea punishment based the proposition that
knows that god their creator and
but not everyone that god you have
nothing terribly difficult all this and well known
reasonably biblically literate the only controversy
and that makes holding with the bible rules out
read the read you missed
bad suggestion for just before
those who pretend not know what being said and what
when atheists claim that they know god exists and
know what they contradict the bible which clearly says
the authority the bible its claim
repeat what wrote above for the sake getting
you may trust the but your trusting
make any more credible
the bible says that everyone clearly reason

while the condemnation those that
that there evidence for the existence god that his will
must deliberately ignore the the ignorance itself
they have ignore the the bible far
from universally the bible not proof
only proof that some people have thought that there

father recently bought the business price was pounds
and father approached the people the community for raised
pounds interest free loans from friends and relatives and
muslims had cash and the rest got business after
paying off the muslim lenders many them helped him with further loans
help him clear the bank debt and save him from further this
example muslim community helping one why did they help
because their common identity turn father has helped
with people buying houses minimise the amount intrest they pay
and some cases buy houses intrest free with the help those more
fortunate the
this how banks got started the first
sooner later your father and his pals will lend money someone
who eventually goes and then they will realise that they
been managing risk very then they will ask themselves
what that they need quantify and persuade borrowers
not take greater loans than they can and since they
all want the worry doing the calculations and handling the

problem with your argument that you not who

false are back square khomeini and hussein are
still innocent and defined evil good islamic
kent
	the problem with your argument that you not who
believer and who may this something known only
the person your assumption that anyone who
not necessarily
that still leaves the door totally open for hussein
they could still considered true and you

you have apply your rule well with you

called john was textbook class
had comparative religion some such has some decent
bibliographies each chapter jumping off point for further
religions directly but describes each one individually
and notes few but nothing have read could even
remotely described preachy christian christianity

divided according major regions the world where the biggies began

began search for the quoted passages and
for and find what they said they
saw this show while and when heard these kids
quote the bible justify their racist looked
that quote about jesus hating jews jesus himself was
curiousity had been piqued such

which passage was was that jesus was condemning

	any even your interpretation correct this does
not imply that the killings are religously which was
the original seeming
replying your blanket claim that they
religiously
they irish catholics the south not kill irish protestants
the yet have precisely the same history behind those
who think the killings are religously motivated ignore the rather
obvious matter british partition and misguided patriotism
both
false you claimed the killing were religiously
and saying not saying that
each and every killing religiously spelled out
the problems fault along the religious divide because the historical
roots this thing have catholic country partitioned and populated
protestant the grotesque killing soldiers and
civilians supposedly motivated civil rights and
only difficult understand insofaras insanity hard
understand religion need not invoked explain
does anyone else see the contradiction this
claim that killings are not religously
all that means that the church
believers are doing what they always with history

frank not hatching
	just borrowed book from the library fatwa
found this useful passage regarding the legitimacy the
was also common knowledge prescribed islamic that the
was only applicable where the jurisdiction islamic law
the sentence has passed islamic court
executed the state machinery through the due process the
islamic let alone individuals
take the law into their own the sentence when
carried out the state through the usual machinery and not
indeed becomes criminal act take the law into
own hands and punish the offender unless the process
the offender must brought the notice
court and the court who shoud decide how deal with
law applies equally muslim well
agree fully with the above statement and what meant
previous statements about islam not being anarchist and the
law not being despite the being
such clarification from the ulama muslims
britain before and after imam fatwa made very clear
since islamic law not applicable the hadd
punishment cannot applied
disagree with this conclusion about the the
islamic law all wherever they may the above conclusion
does not strictly follow from the but only the conclusion
that the fatwa cannot according islamic
agree that the punishment cannot applied rushdie even
well
from the looks like that from islamic viewpoint
constitutes perhaps could
out limb and call khomeini this
certainly putting price the head rushdie britain criminal
act according islamic
think understood muslims that
islamically least the basis
such myself and others who have posted here
umar khan and gregg further and say
even the punishment constituted the fatwa against islamic law
our
gregg
	understanding that generally agreed upon the ulema
that islamic law applies only islamic
which the take the law into own
hands criminal these are matters for the not for
khomeini offered cash prize for people
take the law into their own hands something
against islamic
this also understanding the majority islamic
believe there are also certain legal rulings all
five schools law sunni and can levelled against
muslim both within and outside
not know apostasy accompanied and
open hostility falls into this category the know
that
apostasy has very rarely been punished let alone
the death
understanding that ruling was not based the
law apostasy was well known that rushdie was apostate
long before wrote the offending novel and certainly there
precedent the islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for
believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that this
ruling applies both within and outside the domain
islamic state and can carried out the reward was
not offered khomeini but individuals within
stuff deleted
think you are muddying the issue you seem assume that
fatwa was issued due the the
understanding that fatwa was issued response the
and the view then
your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for
would concur that the thrust the fatwa what was
levelled the author and all those who assisted the publication
the the charge can encompass
number lesser remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stressed that
the condemnation the and the removal the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
but you are correct point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the islamic charges such fasad are
levelled not
the rushdie situation was followed iran for several months before the
issuance the rushdie went media
presenting himself lone knight guarding the sacred values
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns people
crazy enough actually hold their religious beliefs
fanning the flames and milking the controversy boost
his image and push the was everywhere the then
muslim demonstrators several countries were killed while
protesting against the rushdie appeared momentarily
then climbed back his media horse once again
attack the muslims and defend his sacred was this
point that the fatwa was
the fatwa was levelled the person rushdie any actions
rushdie that feed the situation contribute the legitimization
the the book remains circulation not some independant
will its own but the will the author and the the fatwa
against the person rushdie encompasses his actions the
crime was certainly crime progress many and was being
played out played the the full view the
not sure about this but think the charge also
applies rushdie and may encompassed under the umbrella
the

jim broke the second rule copeland
god dead and the actor plays his part
his words fear will find their way place your heart history
without the voice reason every faith its own curse will teach
without freedom from the past things can only get worse nothing
	this the outrageous cost putting someone death cell
years court extra and the benefits the death
entirely
because your earlier claim that the one innocent death
overrides the benefit all the obviously but
argument for doing away with the death went
war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all the time
our determination who the enemy really then
there way win the
fortunately have folks like your good self
and was therefore deemed acceptable slaughter tens even hundreds
thousands iraqis order liberate won the
hurrah
the number civilian iraqi deaths were way and
exploited for emotionalism the liberal news the
facts are that less iraqis died the gulf war than did civilians
any other war comparable size this this was due mostly
the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only
the idea that iraqi citizens died
not even iraqi soldiers
and they were the ones being you think that the
and its allies were specifically out kill and maim iraqi
either the smart bombs hit their targets know they
they were targeting civilian targets which hardly condusive
destroying military the military mission planners are
not they know they have hit targets win
hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against
not laudable goal one wants the people rise against their
some innocent people maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing
along that road need bombed perhaps that kid with half
his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs
entirely but worth the death few innocents save the
the kuwaiti after the iraqis may
not have had chance vote for but they showed their acceptance
his regime not assassinating all that surrendering and
fleeing along open roads was just devious were entirely within
our rights bomb just without finding out they were
how about all the innocent people who died
hear you bemoaning war never exact but
with smart becoming more exact with smaller percentage
civilian sometimes mistakes are targets are
innocents war the way really
but the allow tyrannical dictators treat the earth
like one big rummage grabbing everything they can get
like patrick henry said some years know not what
course others may take but for give give
war always the price one must willing pay one
wishes stay
the death penalty was conceived deterrent but the legal
shenanigans that have been added lengthy court
have relegated that purpose very small part what
should hence the question instate the death penalty
was meant and see that deters get rid
reinstate the death penalty the way ought all that shit
about fair trials and court appeals just gets the way
give the police the absolute right gun down the and save
ourselves the expense all those
think the would never have had spend
much money cleaning after riots and holding showcase trials the cops
had been allowed their job quick bullet through the head
rodney king and another for the and everyone would have been
saved great deal unnecessary paperwork and
after the police decide that ought the
fact that the death penalty has been shown not have any deterrent effect
over entirely
mathew
your sarcasm noted but you are completely
you come off sounding like complete although
feel sure that was not your
the iraqi war was sure that appeasement would have
worked better than just like did guess
have fought either just think all those innocent
german civilians killed dresden and how about all the poor
french who died the crossfire because invaded the
should have just let hitler take over and speaking
german instead english right
tyrants like hussein his kind understand
they only understand the point only regret
that bush wimped out and have the military roll into
now hussein still power and the iraqi sacrifice
mention the americans who was for liberating kuwait
was good but wiping hussein off the map been
and for poor rodney did you ever stop and think
the jury the first trial brought back verdict
those who have been foaming the mouth for the blood those
policemen certainly have looked further than the video
but the jury looked the evidence which you and
have not when one makes judgment without the benefit
trial where evidence can presented both one has simply
lowered himself the level vigilante
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke but instead tends
support the case against the
law this country intended protect the rights the
whether they criminals one not found guilty there
reasonable doubt and only the jury position
assess the evidence and render anyone else simply
succumbing verbal

	think right about daughter was born there and
think she has any german rights vote live there the
all she british citizen virtue
but not for think
children could british virtue her the same
fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship making
application for might require immigration but
almost certain that once applied for citizenship inevitable
this
germany has extremely restrictive citizenship the
ethnic germans who have lived russia for over years
automatically become citizens they move but the

few books the subject have also been mentioned addition
the one you these may hard but think may
take stab out know the one film saw this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes have seen which were
used show science the koran posted were also pretty
suspect that these books will extrapolate awful lot the
quotes they
least one poster the islam channel seems have some misgivings
about the practice using the koran decide what good
wonder islam has ever come with the equivalent the christians
any would interesting find history
scientific interpretations the see anyone used the koran
support earlier science which has since been all too
easy look science exists today and then passages

why read the papers that the qumram texts had
some did
reading newspapers learn about this kind stuff not the best idea
the newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant the subject
and are prone exaggeration the interests having
story bigger
back this have the masoretic the
various targums and the
the ancient greek the masoretic text the
standard jewish text and essentially does not some places has
obvious all which are copied faithfully from copy
these passages the past were interpreted reference the targums and
the
the septuagint differs from the masoretic text two
includes additional and some passages there are
variant readings from the masoretic text addition
the various corrupted must emphasized the best
these variations are only signifcant bible and
have little theological
the dead sea scroll materials add this ancient almost all
isaiah and fragments various sizes almost all other there
also abundance other but far there
sign there any hebrew antecdent the apocrypha extra texts the
far analysis has there are also variations
between the dss texts and the masoretic these tend reflect the
where the latter obviously the
differences are not significant there this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking the
but far this
the dss important because there almost textual tradition the
unlike for the
wingate peace
but strife closed the

	questions for why get
about the idea that relativism than
the degree that relativism more accurate decription the
than provides more power and ability
think you lose the right talk about the truth once you say values are
accuracy value happens agree with
substance what you say but clear that least
values are truth better than peace
than education better than know these
know
while agree that these are generally held
question whether they come very close being objective
especially considering that one time another each has been
viewed being doubt you could even come with
anything that could said universally
and when referred was using the term
realizing full well that there may not even such
for the that morals then two
can recognize that neither has lock the absolute
and they can proceed negotiate workable compromise that
the desired
they because they acknowledge front that the desired
not after the meaning
some the relativists have values compromise
impossible what happens what happens
one relativist has value value bombs
shopping after morals are these values
said
true but they cannot said anything more than
personal one thing notably lacking most extremists any
sense accountability the justification for any
socially unacceptable behaviour invariably some
absolute moral
that there absolute two disagreeing
can either both wrong just one them there
room for once you beleive absolute
must accept that you are amoral that everyone who disagrees
you
one can accept that one does not know the whole part
the objective truth about morality may well that flexibility
than compromise better than believing you have lock
the same can believe objective reality
claiming know the mechanism for quantum who shot
objective truth that says one cannot know the objective
interesting
certainly one can have morals belief that compromise
but compromise the absolute truth not something most
people very suppose one could hold compromise
being absolute but then what happens when someone else
insists how you compromise
choice between peaceful compromise endless
say that compromise seems
would but bloody pointless speak
matter your liking for peace any better founded
someone liking for looking for way say
that and relativism
almost invariably when considering the relative value one thing
over morals people only consider those
aspects which justify desired action justifying
commitement peace might argue that lets people live long
healthy and peaceful while that much may well
incomplete ignoring the benefits war killing off the most
agressive member trimming down the stimulating
the equation always more complex than
characterize relative morals merely following own
conscience desires unduly simplify

this only the first even were strong deterrent

higher value their way thinking over the theistic way the

adam
adam john often have laughed the weaklings
who thought themselves good simply because
	over tend recognise two
weak
strong
strong and must quibble with your assertion
that the position requires believe that
commonly described this belief merely
formed the basis including certain
amount
fully accept that could and will swayed suitably
convincing thus while believe that gods this does
not imply part that
let first say that believe that gods fact
different than believing god
will argue that your latter believe that gods
does rest upon faith that you are making positive statement
that gods rather than merely saying
know and therefore believe them and not believe then
once not believe god different than saying
believe that god does not still maintain the even
after reading the that strong atheism requires
but first let say the
might have language problem here regards and
maintain that god does not
exist means have being space and god does not have
being god kierkegaard once said that god does not
with this feel rather pointless
debate the called god and that not what
doing believe that god the source and ground
when you say that does not also accept this
statement but obviously mean two different things
what follows will use the phrase existence
and this the sense that think you are using
would like clarification upon what you mean existence
also might differ upon what means have here what
webster
faith
allegiance duty loyalty
fidelity promises
sincerity intentions
belief and trust and loyalty god
belief the traditional doctrines religion
firm belief something for which there proof
complete trust
something that believed with strong system
religious beliefs
syn see belief
one can never prove that god does does not when you say
that you believe god does not and that this opinion
upon will have ask observtions are
you refering there are observations pro con that
are valid here establishing positive all observations
can only point you direction direction that might even
predisposed predisposed for people whoes
partents also tend actually draw conclusion
about the god requires leap and
you have made this leap when you actively say believe that god
not think that both statements are
arguing over the god precisely the wrong way
find him use because personal god the only
viable concept person wants use course
god neither nor she but have choice but
you want explain myself further
glad
and someone does not agree with even they violently
disagree ones advantage start name person
thinks misunderstood something the they they think
have not read them well just point out the error

good deal more confusion you started off with the
that there was some and you admit
you finished with recursive murder
but eactly what murder and what not itself
appeal
think you mean not but that
recursiveness has just horribly inefficient ask
any assembly
you have switch targets but only now you are
what the what you mean are you
that there some out there
form our morals achieve
for the goal morality the survival and
the another example moral system
within the declaration which states that
guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit you
have moral must define the purpose the that
shall moral unto what
the line that says people should guaranteed liberty
and the pursuit happiness inalienable complete lie
and the very authors that line were the process
liberty never always purchased some
almost always the cost whos liberty more
similarly for right when one person must die save
even group whos life more
that leads into the classic question the value the death
especially for serial whos life and liberty more
the serial the according that beautiful
those two rights should completely that noone should
able remove this admittedly the serial
killer has restricted some life but not his
own inviolate according the declaration
certainly violation the golden thought had
murder intentional killing against his
like means that killing infant not murder because
cannot against its infant has will
similarly for people who are brain dead
under current accidental killing still how will you
include
you responded this asking whether not the execution
person under our system capital punishment was murder
fail see what this has with never claimed that our
morality was objective
thought that was your very first that there was
kind and that example that was
murder you want claim that any
the only real golden rule life who has the makes the
might makes that now what wrong
with
murder violates the golen which certainly pillar most
moral not assuming that our current system
the manner its implementation are objectively think that
very good but
you mean the golden rule almost every system
implemented has used that deal much
the you seem understand the difference between
and keith schneider murder
this that and the jon livesey may
say according personal system all
humans against their will and and what
legal definition murder may the saudi
the prc may matters not whit
welcome
what not you can find some part some societal
that are not please tell think
there are
would assume system based clear and fundamental
while implies clear line
sounds like euphemisms the difference seems that objective

the one true muslim left the
	wonder how many atheists out there care speculate the face the world
atheists were the majority rather than the minority group the
probably would have much the same problems with only slight shift
weekends might not inviolate common work days
week and instead american would have
religious persons religious belief seems more
crutch and justification for actions than guide determine
people would have come with more fascinating
rationalizations for their but that could fun
seems that for most religion america matter
that you have extreemists both but large majority
make too much issue about long you
have never had suffer the but just north
and see the and the reasonable people most things tend
reasonable religion
how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor
value their way thinking over the theistic way the
selfish argument would that both lines thinking evolved from the
inherent one different from the
but then again measuring stick must drawn
and cannot assign value system beliefs its
the only other alternative apply its how
its own
bother according higher value just about
anybodys want fall that because you
start then you are then decide which says
there and also what about those who have inferior
modes idic diversity infinite
argue over but not over much
just inflation has
	bobby then states that satan has free that
does god wants him this brings host
god therefore have free will
god directing god which part
his infinite self good and which
would like for once solid not
hope gave you fairly solid answer this simply agree
with the embodied version satan who separate creation
the belief which ascribe that evil not
absence this fits with all the
logic about things having dual knife can used
sculpt and can used like evil
seen this view neither force nor satan
there are several verses
the holy which appear support this view and several
traditions
for there tradition that food should never left open
shelf table lest enter appears
that this reference yet undiscovered the
evil effect spoiled food described
there are many examples satan which
and there are quite physical descriptions heaven and hell the
holy the there have been times the spiritual
and intellectual evolution the modern human when these physical
descriptions and satan were taken quite literally
and that for the mentioned the tradition
cited for was sufficient the absence theory
about germs and disease spread worms simply describe the
which was passed consumer spoiled food
which begs the satan this case
how can you certain allah not
the same
the bottom line that describing spiritual plane
human language something like describing person
who has been blind from you may want read the book
flatland you the the first
intended light hearted description mathematical
deleted for space
when language fails because cannot used adequately describe
another dimension which cannot experienced the then
such conventions and the like come
the described terms which have
and meaning for the like all
mise must made when speaking clarity and directness
equivalence and the like are all
but what else can you
this why asked the how would you then
know god exists spirit being rather than
just being okay say
satan just but then you
have justify this belief and justify that god
not some metaphor for something
say this because there are many instances
satan described being the tormentor
the old testament book the temptor the
new testament the same god too
described being how know
one metaphorical and not the
belief god bar
consider the case even satan were
the satanist would have believe
god justify this have
case where someone does believe but
religious they are bobby

can god uncreate
for would violate his own nature which cannot
nature after the which
statement his inherent existence
existence cannot
mentioned must not very
what you mean omnipotent you mean
that god should able this creates
definition omnipotence which effectively
omnipotence must mean and
not able
let illustrate
suppose the united states were the only nuclear power suppose
further that the military could not effectively countered any
nation group the has the power into any country
any time for any reason straighten things out the leaders the
see the would militarily
but suppose further that the holds not
interfering the internal affairs any such the current
civil war the former yugoslavian
technically this the would have the power
unilaterally into yugoslavia and straighten out the but
effectively the could not intervene without violating its own policy
the policy were held
strongly then there would never question that would
ever the would limited what
could actually although had the power
the would simply want for such idea would
beyond the consideration its leaders given such inviolate
god effectively limited the same all but
cannot use his power way that would violate the essence what
himself
hope this helps clear some the misunderstanding concerning

god did create was life according protein code which
and can without delving into deep discussion
the the scenario you outline reasonably
but all the evidence that familiar with not only does
not support but indicates something far the
latest about billion years and has had life for
about billion those humans have only been around for
about the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and long before
there were there are fossils that show signs
mostly bone but there are not just
fossil but what been able glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for long human sin was what
brought about disease though then
how could exist before
god created the original genetic code
and without and without getting sidetracked into
theological ramifications the original the main effect
the original sin for this discussion was remove
from protection since their choice cut
off from intimate fellowship with their
caused them come under the dominion who then assumed
over the
humanity was longer under protection but under
was great feat for satan genetically engineer
both and although the forces
selection tend improve the survivability the
the genetic code tends more than offset
know many evolutionary who know more about
biology than you claim who will strongly disagree with there
evidence that the human genetic code any
perfect seems adapt its
collective really curious what you mean
degeneration the genetic
being more tends accumulate errors adversely
our and ability fight off while the
dna bacteria and viruses tend become more efficient
infection and bad
seem pretty good job adapting viruses and
and they only very small percentage microlife
harmful and that small percentage seems reasonalby
constant but the ranks keep for bubonic
plague used really nasty sure but
still pops from time even and
much part that because better but even
when people get the the symptoms tend less severe than
the this seems partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long and because the really nasty variants
the poor not and
died off for lack nearby
could wrong but from what gather acne only few
hundred years and used though seems
getting less nasty
hence
have newborns that suffer from and bacterial
wait have humans were created
you admit that have inbuilt abiliy fight off
seems unlikely that making the would also gift
humans with the means fight them simpler make the diseases less
wants far can our immune
imperfect though they may must have been built into
want clear are you saying that god was planning
ahead for the time when satan would charge building immune
system that was the time that god made
our immune systems ahead knowing that adam and eve would sin and
their descendents would need fight off
may more explanation than you
prepared but god not responsible for
satan had nothing with the original inception
evolution random chance would have produced them since
forsook
another you mean the
perfect and without
system would incapable degrading over system
that without constant become imperfect
perfect
that god did something like writing masterpiece novel
bunch gum wrappers held together with that the
original genetic were but were
inferior materials that had carefully tended would fall
why could god not have used better
was god creating system that could maintain
did just choose not
newborns are but god does not cause their

the explanation you that aware

they never explicitly rejected
temporary temporary temporary none
teflon how and easy clean but
what would you expect from bunch people who even agree
the phases the
	this kind argument cries for
you originally
did not create
nor responsible for the maladies
god did create was life according protein code which
and can without delving into deep discussion
god created the original genetic code
and without
you have any evidence for the code was once and
has degraded ever have some evidence favour
this
perhaps the biggest the code that full
which are called because they
intervene with the coding regions impressive amount
evidence suggests that introns are very ancient
likely that early exons represented early protein
the number introns decreasing appears that
intron loss can and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar structure their
the other the possibility that introns have been inserted
presents several logical introns are removed
splicing mechanism this would have but
introns are intron insertion would have
required targeting random insertion would not
since sequences for intron removal are
transposition sequence usually leaves
trace long terminal repeats and target site and
these are not found near intron
seriously recommend reading textbooks molecular biology and
genetics before posting like
try molecular biology the gene lodish
molecular biology the cell for
the question was posed theological context does
god cause disease and answer likewise from
theological perspective less valid than purely
scientific just
scientific perspective supported the whereas
theological perspectives often fail fulfil this
think you misread said god made the genetic code
but that mean perfect has certainly evolved
for the would you please cite few references that support
your your assertion less valid than the scientific
unless you support some
has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than thought for sex might
have evolved defence against view supported
computer simulations
thought was higher energy rays like gamma
and cosmic rays that caused most the
thermal energy that does most the although
usually mild and easily fixed enzymatic
neither what the atmosphere was like the
time when god created according most
biologists not claim that life began billion years ago after
that would only half billion years after the earth
was would still too primitive support
seem remember figure more like billion years ago for
the origination life anyone with better
replace with since there need
invoke any creator the earth can formed without
most recent estimates the age the earth range between
billion and earliest signs life true but
date back billion
this would leave more than billion years for the first cells
sorry give any this based the course
evolutionary biochemistry attended
was great feat for satan genetically engineer
both and although the forces
selection tend improve the survivability the
the genetic code tends more than offset
you this you have any evidence for

excuse but this that know you must
you know what pathogens you know what
point mutations you know that everything can come

response your last and neither
you may very well believe that and accept but you
cannot
hope you forget have that suggests
everything can come about you have evidence against
this one does not have

right path walk take look the evidence you

theology does not use this seriously doubt
could ever come right
being more tends accumulate errors adversely
our and ability fight off while the
dna bacteria and viruses tend become more efficient
infection and bad hence
have newborns that suffer from and bacterial
you are supposing not valid bacteria and viruses
not exist cause they are just another manifests
general principle evolution only replication saves replicators
from are just efficient method for our dna
survive and the less efficient methods make
the
and for the last please present some evidence for your claim that
human dna degrading through evolutionary some people have
claimed that the opposite true have suppressed our
and thus are bound seen much evidence for either
but then where this relevant discussion
answering question why are there genetic
and why are there many bacterial and viral diseases which require
babies develop original
say
nothing but your explanation does
not fails
you may but the fact that you know that
satan not and neither
suppose that evil being like satan would
inconceivable that might responsible for many the ills
that affect think
could have done much better the problem
seems satan necessary explain any they are
just inevitable any product
did say seems like another bad
actually what done oversimplify what said the
point that your summary words takes new
never said that people are
punished getting why did say that free moral
choices have attendent mankind chooses reject
people have done since the then they should not
expect god protect them from adverse events entropic
not expecting god expect him leave
would also like hear why you believe your choices are indeed
this interesting philosophical and the answer
not seems
what consequences would you expect from rejecting
admit not perfect but working
good library bookstore good starting
what does this have with the price tea the
question which provided biology and genetics are
fine subjects and important scientific but they explain
god created and set life they explain
the why behind its subsequent
why there and your proposition was something
that not supported the this why recommend
these
there any need invoke any why prime evidence
for the whole universe can come into existence without
any recent cosmological theories
why people still insist
thanks for your fine and sagely but
not highly motivated learn all the details
biology and although sure find
fascinating for realize that the details
not change the big that god created life the

this one nation under when the fundies try take over the
that may well provide the next president the united states
that they can force their beliefs the rest the
why subscribe
the middle people who mind readers pop
tell what concoct some
reason why share their particular
think should just accept
particularly dig fundamentalist have been
that reject allah because too proud embrace
and that reject krishna because eyes are but most
religious nuts who post are some kind militant
who accept that others share their this
stuff should kept where
the absence belief any
you have problem with
would like say that atheism fact beilief
belief something you hold with ador and atheist says there are this cannot therefore you are excepting this
that you complain much about how the
christians are trying force their beliefs but you
anything about how the such madamme murry
the atheists association austin and robert the chicago have been trying force their beliefs everyone trying get rid god from our society banning religious paintings from parks during forcing cities change their town seals there any mention god sherman has trying get the slogan god off the american you also talk about creation they are fact myths and tha
concrete evidece you probably
and that just enforces point that your atheism just much belief this not please show why
covalt
the only real problem have with the argument christianity that they seem ignore their origin that being asiatic soon christians become the
good non buddhists they are supposed then might
speak not for place but
was and will the atf follow koresh current through
his ascention

argument goes quotes appear but not
almost codified way they were matthew they are
similar enough point knowledge and
entirely different
assuming you are presenting see how this argument
really leads any firm the material john not sure
exactly what referred but take for granted the similarity
the one could have almost
any relationship between the right john getting straight from
are talking date texts not the age the the usual
for the time order matthew and luke does not consider
respective says matthew has read the text and luke
matthew probably that
the version the have heard has matthew and luke
independently relying mark and one would think that luke relied
have the grating inconsistencies the
for one
assumed that john knew the content the evidence
that not
this the part that particularly new were possible that
you could point
got the info was the late
early and was possibly old
they are from about why they shed doubt the order
john after the rest the
because closes the gap between writing and the existing
copy quit the further away from the the more copies can
and therefore survival becomes more
think step source that luke and mark
matthew learned their stories directly from then really
believe the sort transformation from jesus that
people news one generally gets better
than
john then nothing more
john was disciple not generally the style and language
with the theology are usually used
not really impressed with the but really
pointing this out and pointed out one cannot make
these arguments about see reason not accept
authentic
step and one generation removed bad even our compare that
reports similar events our century almost illiterate
the best analogy would reporters talking the which
not
other one does not know what the original mark did look like
arguments based mark are pretty

what about that revelation
talking about this intellectual engagement
obviously risk one
people say that the concept metaphysical and religious knowledge
not not particularly impressed with problems
the problem this case least bad that
trying explain quantum mechanics and relativity the terms ordinary
one can get some rough but the language from
the perspective ordinary and from the
perspective being rather inexact
analogous situation obtains the problem
that the descriptive language not
case holds reliable can you show how you establish
this word essentially meaningless the unless you
can show how reliability can

	there means that can possibly think prove beyond doubt
god does not exist anyone has all tell
lacking this ability absolute being
becomes act faith and and this cannot
accept nothing blind
pink flying need say
harbor beliefs there good evidence for god
some folks call this does not suffer
think
for many the lack belief gods secondary
epistemological what accept reliable way
there are known valid logical arguments for the existence
nor there any empirical evidence that they most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea god one that

basis empirical reliable way
could you expand your definition seems bit monolithic
but not sure that you intend for

equals the french that jerry lewis and

like this perhaps the issue learning
absurdities merit further
	personal objection that find capital punishment
and unusual punishment under all
can has occurred frequently
since the dawn hardly
take issue with the single innocent life taken

innocents die due many why have you singled out
accidental false execution the one take issue
keith
	several years periodically asked charley wingate explain this
alternative rationality which propounds enthusiastically
pops every few his reluctance explain indicates
not
said enough times that there that should think you
have caught and there but the point
alternative the problems metaphysical
religious knowledge are should humans cannot
there truly then you have basis whatsoever
for your the usual line which you call prejudgment
and that reason all here you admit
that you have possible basis for the claim that
there anything other than reason that reason inapplicable
religious except possibly that reason conflicts with
this sounds very much like provide rational defense for
but prefer discard rationality rather than accept that
may hope makes you but your repeated and
unfounded assertions this effect advance your
these are for nominal they can

what about that revelation
talking about this intellectual engagement
obviously risk one
now here the core let suggest
will grant that god and uses revelation communicate
with revelation taking the form from your
own infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor
makes him take and then hides away for few hundred
there exists human who has not personally experienced
this person observes that not only these revelations seem
contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects the
observed world all this person has ever but there are
many mutually contradictory claims
based can this person blamed for absent
personal revelation their that there almost certainly
nothing this
not not particularly impressed with problems
the problem this case least bad that
explain quantum mechanics and relativity the terms ordinary
one can get some rough but the language from
perspective ordinary and from the
being rather inexact
analogous situation obtains the problem
the descriptive language not
absent this better and absent observations support the
claims can one blamed for doubting the whole
here what driving have thought long time about
have come the honest conclusion that there
nothing like the ones proposed any religion that familiar
there does happen christian will held
accountable for such honest
meek can the the rest are going the
robert heinlein
	get the
opinion that sex makes the
likelihood sex more
sex helps break down partnerships and leads
greater divorce this creates trauma
and less stable environment for who are
more likely grow with psychological problems such
and sex outside marriage the long harmful

has nothing with adultery once committed into the
see more how committed you are not foisting pain
and how confident you are about
what someone does within their marriage their own
not and not have witnessed strong relationships
incorporate
would agree with your assertion about children children should not witness such confusing relationships adultery stressful
which assume general how can expect children
where the evidence for the there are just
generalities can for read that the
the percentage youth people who suffer from
depression has been steadily climbing western societies
what was reading referred particularly the one
can detect trend towards greater occurrence sex outside marriage
this century western societies particularly with the
the but even before that think the
the would not have been
particularly with the gradual weakening christianity and consequently
christian moral teachings against sex outside propose
that these two trends greater level general depression society
other psychological and greater sexual promiscuity are
with the latter being prime cause the cannot
provide any evidence beyond this this but the whole thesis
seems very reasonable and request that people ponder upon
more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards
you just pick your two favorite notice correlation
and make sweeping statement you and
but that does not mean that valid reasonable
best gross oversimplification the factors people
argument mainly proposal what think plausible argument
against sex one which personally believe has some
main purpose for posting here show that
argument can made against this
stage not saying that this particular viewpoint proven
anything like just that try convince you
all this particular point would probably have lot
work researching what has been done this order
gather further which simply not have time
also note that said that think sex prime
the generally greater levels psychological
especially western not saying
prime only just prime
one the significant contributions this think when
you say you think view you have forgotten this
admit that there are probably other but think that
sex subsequent destabilization the
significant factor the rise psychological problems like
depression western society this

best gross oversimplification the factors people
the social interactions all the changing factors our society
far too complicated for just have hold the
handles and hope that are heading for soft but one
for depression and the destruction the nuclear family not
solely sex out
note that said that depression and the destruction the
nuclear family due specifically
said that was prime not prime

fred rice
	point view that the argument sexism just simply
not let give you how about permitting
temporarily leave her job due pregnancy should that
happens gives particular right only
despite the fact that completely
such because think
like form
using obvious physical cultural differences deny
portion the population the same rights
this your example above holds water
discrimination men maternity fact
quite convinced were anyone experiment with male
would possible for such future father take
medical
argued this thoroughly about weeks men and women are
different and much
recent evidence for this statement present the book
anne moir and david recommend you find copy and read
their book overview recent scientific research this topic
and well
women and men are different some the law can only
adequately take into account their needs these areas where they are
different also taking into account the ways which men and women
are maternity leave example this takes into
account that women get does not give women the same rules
would give because treat women like treats men this
instance would this just simply obvious example
where men and women are intrinsically
people make the argument that sexism
maternity leave sexist because men not get
men not have the same access leave that women the same
extent and therefore matter however much
man get pregnant and have maternity never and
therefore the law man can have access maternity
matter how hard tries get hope this
maternity leave example where sexist law because the
sexism here just reflects the nature making men and women
there are many other differences between men and women which
are far more subtle than and find out more these
recommend you have look the book
your point that perhaps some day men can also pregnant
men can one day become pregnant will having biologically
become have womb and the other factors required for
pregnancy usually wrapped the definition what woman
your when seen you
are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that
women can have they also become women which actually just supports
statement that maternity leave
discrimination comes when woman denied opportunities
her sexual
most religious sexual and doubt that
the female not allowed into the priestly
and general subjugated that she has aspirations
equal she ought entitled
there official priesthood islam much this function
taken islamic there are female islamic scholars and
female islamic scholars have always existed example from
early islamic history the who was recognized
her time and recognized our time islamic
matter how sweetly you coat part the role religions
have served the function oppressing the
whether forcing her procreate the extent where
opportunity for denying her
the same facilities the males are
you have evidence for your blanket statement about all and
dispute could and about women but
recently reposted something here under the heading and
still your suggest you read reposted
from has disappeared from
still might forgot what its original title
was will email you you
roman catholic church the most blatant the
they actually istitutionalised celibate but the
religious are let woman attempt escape her
child bearer and the wrath god descends
your statement that religions are
statement based simply lack knowledge about religions other than
christianity and perhaps
accept your affirmation that islam grants women the same rights
men when you can show that any muslim woman can aspire the
position khomeini and there are artificial religious
social obstacles her path achieve
who mentioned was not only islamic scholar but also
one military
the equivalent hillary within and
consider discussing the issue with
the first who died just before the
journey from mecca was successful
you cannot make strong case for your viewpoint when your
viewpoint based ignorance about world
fred rice
	has been some discussion the pros and cons about sex outside
personally think that part the value having lasting partnerships
men and women that this helps provide stable and secure
for children grow
addition chris what about
from islamic homosexuality not the norm for
cannot really say much about the islamic viewpoint homosexuality
not something have done much research
fred rice
	rosenau with great
contradictory cannot
property correct this
things defined contradictory language not exist
will object definitions you then amend
things described contradictory language not exist
come something which plainly failures
are merely failures
how about this object that one both
euclidean square and euclidean hold that object satisfying
this description could the description and hence
describes object that could not
suppose someone pointed and object
one both euclidean square and euclidean this does
not mean that the bicycle does not measn that the description
was incorrectly
the atheist descriptions god that have been presented with
are and hence describe something that cannot
your position far can that god but the
descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
this roughly analogous someone who has never seen
when they ask for description from people who claim have seen
are told that can they blamed for
doubting rather strongly that this exists
not

	had clear this there may good evolutionary
arguments against but these
would seem odd homosexuality had any evolutionary function
time man has sex with woman they intend produce
wonder the world obviously you keep the

purpose means limit population growth then your own
the talking about evolutionary one
the most basic requirements evolution that members
those who have purpose that
guess all those social insects which
have one breeding queen and whole passel sterile workers are
the way
these days just people can decide whether not have
children and soon they will able choose sex
another more again
your since homosexuals can not choose reproduce they
must akin people who decide have sex but not both are
each
another sex evolutionary function that exists
that also recreation that
procreate means that sex recreation and
they serve
refer you the species primate closeley related
humans chimpanzees very they have sex all the
homosexual well when the group finds they
have before the sleep they have after they
escape from fight off they have sex serves very important
social function above and beyond reproduction this species
closely related there some indication that sex performs
social function but even this shows that
such function not

	the bsa has taught tolerance
met this thought all gays were the bsa has
could give much the same testimonial about experience scout
back the the issue but the principles were the

think this discussion belong here and his intolerance the
only acceptable position scouting should take the bsa has
been hijacked the religious but some the core values have
survived spite the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
given seeing testimonial like this reminds that
scouting still worth fighting
cautionary you must realize that your experience with this
camp leader was the bsa you may putting him risk publicizing
word could leak out the bsa
bill mayne
	always thought that homophobe was only word used act
beleive real people used see agree
the homophobe one who actively and
militantly attacks homosexuals because actually latent
homosexual who uses his hostility conceal his true
since everyone who disapproves condemns homosexuality
homophobe implication must necessarily follow that
all men are latent homosexuals bisexual the very
crap crap crap crap definition any type comes from
phobia irrational fear hence homophobe only act
the word apparently general use perhaps the
wouldst thou prefer were communicate with thou
does arachnophobe have irrational fear being does
agoraphobe have irrational fear being wide open you
understand
obviously someone who has phobia will react they will their best
avoid and that not possible they will either strike out
run gaybashings occur because natural people
who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people
cause them
that what said
what are you taking issue with your remarks are merely
parenthetical mine and add nothing
would seem odd homosexuality had any evolutionary function
than limiting population since evolution only occurs
when the members one generation pass along their traits
subsequent homosexuality evolutionary
take your usage the the sense you seem
then all men are really homosexual and evolution our
species going
time man has sex with woman they intend produce
wonder the world obviously you keep the
monty python sperm and has
purpose means limit population growth then your own
consider the talking about evolutionary one
the most basic requirements evolution that members
species those who have purpose that
another point that the offspring each generation
the participation both parents necessary family must
since homosexuals not they cannot constitute
since the majority humankind part
homosexuality evolutionary contrary nature you
well that your own arguements homosexuals would have
vanished ago due also the parent from single
parent families should put the babies out the cold cos they
your
your homosexuality genetically your
second you prove again that you have idea what context
talking about the preservation the
the fundamental premise the whole
but gets since the overwhelming majority people actually
heterosexual homosexuality social
abberation the homosexual eschews the biological imperative
reproduce and then the social imperative form and participate
the most fundamental social the but
read the expect you have least ten children with
the family these days sex less with procreation
without there would but more with
and you had sex there was the chance producing
these days just people can decide whether not have
children and soon they will able choose sex
another more again
your since homosexuals can not choose reproduce they must
akin people who decide have sex but not both are
each
yet another sex evolutionary function that exists
for that also recreation that
homosexuals procreate means that sex recreation and
nothing they serve
since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some
policy makers that they have civil they are now claiming that
their sexuality
choice that should protected now homosexuality mere
choice and both contrary nature and then
perverse they have even less credibility than before they
became
people are people are who are you tell anyone else how live
their are you fancy
pretty obvious you really think said anything
you just feel obligated respond every not
telling anyone demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice homosexuality merely
alternate that are not that one can reasonably
call perverse context even atheist can realize
course that this comes dangerously close establishing
and that atheists are compelled object that but you
are you have case this
characterize any opposition homosexuality homophobic
ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization
the homosexual but since the charge only intended
really just demogoguery and not taken
fact there are far more persuasive arguments for
suppressing homosexuality than those but consider this
again all your arguments are based outdated likewise the
would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned
eternal someone who crushes his penis
accidently both are
sure your comment pertains but disguised
well see where did mention
your arguments are very you have anything
all
why homosexuals should excluded from participation
the reasons are the same those used restrict them from
their own homosexuals are social and
since any adult role model for
incumbent the parent ensure that the child isolated from
those who would the child this harm means primarily
though that could extended easily
you show who has sex way that everyone would describe
and will take hat baseball meat
another
what has this got with would you pick single point
that you find offensive and explain your would really
like believe that you can discuss this issue
