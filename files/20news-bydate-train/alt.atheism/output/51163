	A human has greater control over his/her actions, than a 
predominately instictive tiger.

	A proper analogy would be:

	If you are thrown into a cage with a person and get mauled, do you 
blame that person?

	Yes. [ providing that that person was in a responsible frame of 
mind, eg not clinicaly insane, on PCB's, etc. ]
