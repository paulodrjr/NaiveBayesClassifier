own personal
you consider the word testify the
surrounding
there are two problems
peter died two millenia the original letters wrote have
long since decayed into were alive today and could
question then this might lend credibility your claims
probably not because after heard people claim with all
sincerity that spoken with elvis but after his
writings were transcribed monks for and
find hard believe that one them somewhere decide
change the wording something make his little
easier
even peter did witness the miracles jesus two millenia
that mean that your deity what the bible says
might just trying convince everyone that nice
even that your deity still alive and active the world
nice but just enough convince especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem fly the face the way

his the passage has with the subject matter which
suddenly appears and then just quickly
until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community wrong about
the josephus your meaningless and should not repeated
even josephus happened would
scholars speak the far more independent

independent evidence and know none have already

you have committed fundamental error you have attempted
your claim with that which you want its different than
saying right because say
your logic full reminds bit the presbyterian
general the assembly defined five fundamentals where
came orthodox protestant
jesus performed jesus was born jesus was bodily
crucifixion atoned for human and here the
clincher the bible the inerrant word presbyterians construe
broadly spritually fundamentalists take the

colorado called forget the whole definition off
but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual and their motto
for with implicit advocation for
live and have never heard such obviously claims
that their posters are appearing over are tad
this and seems what you and and others are
saying that homosexuality sin far cry from
for saying that want
homosexual babysitting for kids doesnt mean endorse
immoral gross homosexual
christians have loooooooooong tradition coersion and oppression
towards those feel
and now have homosexual advocates telling that teach
our kids that homosexuality natural and perfectly acceptable
alternative then they will have done for
the gospel believe not rather seeks ways
and the message and sin
and whatever
one the start your you
know many gays and will not turn back them their right free
form may have lost face with the greater christian
community for the unpopularity but did the abolitionists
against the oppression many were even killed and
treated runaway slaves for being and guess
decided the challenge worth
this sounds real but struck little
presenting yourself you were straight who sticking
his neck out and taking the challenge speaking out support
gays the but was under the impression that you
yourself are all well and but presenting yourself

	good point was that world with truth better than world
with world which were possible say
holding and the and the guy all sit
down crack open bottle whiskey better than the grim alternatives
you this not and the best alternative seems
because other values are such
now that just opinion confuse the claim morality
with the claim have lock
think that this point would actually quite easy
confuse objective morality with relative
that quite christian people have caused
look very after that was the
point the original question this can toss out
christianity because obviously inconsistent with its own
you will bear with will attempt explain this
apparent inconsistency from least one
god exists and the creator mankind the bible then
has pretty concept what makes people tick
god has morality for
that has trouble understanding what good for
detrimental the creature
galatians for are his created
christ jesus for good works which god prepared
beforehand that might walk
contrary what many people assume the pharasees
the morality cannot completely codified list
rules and some every activity
life creates new situation which morality must
there never could enough volumes codify
morality for
throughout mankind has tried reduce morality list
rules you the old have
both principles and specific the time most the
principles were obscured the emphasis men had placed the
volumes additional rules had been made try codify the
application the comfortable with
the
for reference see matthew where jesus explains the difference
between the law and the principles the for
verses have heard that the ancients were
shall not commit commits murder shall
liable the but say you that everyone who
angry with his brother shall liable the
the god gets blurred our inept
interpretation have made our biggest errors
when have allowed any one person group people decide exactly
what god intended for would stay committed

nothing inherently
then simple theories with accurate predictions
not inherently worthwhile you see any flaws
the problem your use the word along with
both definitions three and four are inherently that
they are particular given you
what one person may see another may see
the other some things objective
would interesting know what they

not willing attempt this until someone provides objective
for the notion that science important

this science does not have objective since the
phrase however you asked something
little differently this you asked for objective basis for
the fact that the use science intellectual tool

	the whole making these the commandments that
they reducible set rules moral code
law code algorithm for such things can very helpful
individuals societies but not they are used
personal involvement and responsibility for
the two commandments they are merely rules that are
vague that they are practically devoid michael
siemon acknowledges this every time writes that the resolution
argument over them turns secular and cultural
assumptions that are independent these
the great commandment more than anything call
act you were god and accepting ultimate
your every
the commandment love your neighbor yourself can
reminding man that not god and cannot act
has many traditions present
interpretation where believers are supposed interpret
loving neighbor following various other and
relying their god make things come out precisely
because would wrong for man assume such
once are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants
may twist this you were
mean down rules for other people and nasty them
possible they keep your they are
insistent about this that they have convinced
lot people rightly reject the whole that such
idiocy how god
and who say that this interpretation there
are many passages the bible that their most straightforward
reading show the christian god behaving just this
michael cannot refer claims base commandments
show that such readings are because this divergence
understanding occurs even trying interpret the
claims and addressing conservative
michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
that these conservative christians will
but why should anyone looking for ethical since our
society eager hand one more matter what
may that need principle for the critique ethical systems
which case will profer the once
but these base commandments are too vague serve
principle for the critique ethical the meaning
these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
and cultural notions that the believer brings from how
the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings
other biblical from particular sectarian
from some combination these these commandments
lack sufficient substance themself serve basis for
criticizing ethical what meaning they have comes from
the ethical system the believer brings these
and different bodies christians from the urged
some
bizarre identify any one these however popular
with christianity does not have
does not have specifically christian scripture has very
the way little that
the who desperately commandments for
them with almost support the thing the gospels
which jesus specifically
one
jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish which
would seem bring all properly understand what
means love god and love our there are
parables and teachings the gospels attribute jesus that are
straightforwardly read ethical the pauline
epistles are similarly not clear that these all
come together sensible understanding ethical
the problem lack raw
christian that take the gospel
the conservative christians also take the gospel
what differentiates you the way you interpret the
why and the other christians like
tell you something about
the wide variety interpretations does tell
something about tells that the new testament
authors left sufficiently vague that can serve
the source text for vastly different beliefs about the
nature the christian god and about what men should and
the irony here that there christianity per
that michael can use support the cause lesbians and
christian principle turns this cause
effective only through the principles through
which michael interprets his and the homophobes apply
the christian with equal
their the principles that
make christianity and suspect they would
perhaps without being filtered
christian
michael paints picture american the
rejection the evil many conservative christian
interpretations the but think even more
damaging christianity note that the new testament presents
such vague notions about the nature god and
the nature the good when ordered
interpretation that relies extraneous
think should apply christian where cold drink can
have its value and hot drink can have its but the
lukewarm should spit

kent
	think given your clarification how were
each using the terms fact and only add that
think perhaps feel more strongly about separating
though your usage quite
that the fact evolution still other
still falsified and but since
and consistently supported seems
explicitly try falsify
add here that any falsification rejection does not any way
reduce its current long accurately predicts
describes things can
not pain the but there any reason you
just say theory rather than the evolution
still asking because this whole thread got started
because was bothered post that referred fact
basically leaving off the phrase still without
like the one you just just saying fact
has very different meaning
atomic and alternative theories
are very useful models that
religious overtones requirements unless course you
demand that factual physical entity described exactly
way the theory now formulated talks about
where you fail make important you have
the the gravity and atoms and
into one category with the which have been
explain the the existence these things
predictive considered the the
are still worth
not sure agree may because feel stronger
about separating was trying say that the
proposed explain the and the themselves
are the only realities the existence not
the things that are predictive considered
fact you would there really little planetary particle
systems called atoms out should and more original
would leap faith say there because observe only
the there need there are
atoms out there have decided think about enough
discuss the any not sure being
any clearer than but thought was worth
the bottom think agree two fundamental
theory supported observational evidence
fact evolution theory supported observational
evidence
just theist wants call
theory then has supporting evidence
and neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
with mechanisms talk there really

	asked your god several times with all heart come
wish could believe matter how much confidence
build the universe big and would
nice know have someone watching over
brian pleased with your and honest
believe you have not asked god come why say
because the things you write the and the manner with which
you write you show that you made your own god and are
attempting pass him off the real got news for
yours all sound like your god come you
because your god
gone into this with open layed beliefs aside
time time when had and prayed see what
that would see what more can open myself
short just deciding believe for good and
decide believe for good why not believe some
zeus seems like pretty cool
sorry but when read your not see open
what see lack arrogance and
tell what more can while still remaining true
true yourself have open and end the gain
knowledge the real put your presumptions read the
bible and know that there truly reason for everything and
there exists god that has much love for you that the depth goes beyond
our shallow worldly person who commits himself
seeking will find jesus stands your door and but
person who opens the opens with purpose find
something will learn and see the only thing one
will gain with that attitude
careful not jump the for first there are many passages
the bible that will seem bizarre and assured that even
though they seem alien confident that they are
assured that beyond your present there lies such
deep reasons that once you see you will indeed
will personally guarantee that jesus put will never
thirsty your cup will even flow
from king solomon
the glory god conceal
search out matter the glory
jesus says john
one can come unless the father who sent draws
and john
god loved the world that gave his one and only
that whosoever believes him shall not perish but have eternal
you are included and also pray that the father
drawing which seems doing else you posting
remember you could paul the
paul not only mocked christians you but also had pleasure
stoning yet god showed him saved and paul became
the most celebrated men the history
you see myself better careful and not judge because
you could indeed the next for with the fervor that you attack
one day you might find yourself and like
proclaim the good news jesus with that very same fervor
you could the next what jesus said jesus would
probably say would surely like have why
because peter was cynical and demonstrated great
moments but once peter committed himself task
did with full peter was the only apostle have the
faith walk water jesus
you asked not believe zeus offer eternal
you got nothing gain believing

	told some friends mine two weeks ago that koresh was the fbi and
the batf could not let man like that was testimonial their
stupidity and
now before everyone gets crazy with let say that koresh was crazy
bed but out government was they lied
they told compound had been under survaillance for quite some
whoever was watching the place failed see that koresh went jogging and into
town regular everyone the area claimed have seen him and
wondered why they pick him there are two possible
they see what kind survaillance they
they wanted they wanted publicity and they got
after the first they told that they did not know knew they were
they also said would have been foolish knowing
know now that they intercepted the informants call and went
did they explore all the possibilities for ending the according
them they but according the hartford the woman that raised
koresh was not allowed and see
the fbi agent who she spoke with was bob ricks and according the paper
lot people think you just talk them logically they will come
his grandmother raised vernon real she raise
david
someone who raises you and loves you does not speak you strickly
logical there also emotional level which they can reach
another all during this operation the fbi has been claiming that
they feared mass suicide and that one the reasons that something must
now they claim they never thought would
knew they were going something when they started talking about how
much money this was that was the start the part
part the when knew would come
back the considered and unusal
execute criminals the minds many but look
they knew the parents had gas they did not were not
the children had the plan was pour the gas into the
the seeing what the gas was doing their children were
supposed run out and that would only leave the men deal
spent two years the army and like everyother veteran went through cbr
biological warfare part that training
going into room filled with the same stuff that the children were
subjected make the stuff really interesting the gas also has chemical
agent that irritates the you think its
have doubts the children would become its not the kind
thing you never want this was the the final
waited days for our hostages come home from gave these
people
stated several occasions that there was absolutely nothing this whole
thing that the government could point fbi agent ricks
changed again newclip from the hartford
while expressing regret the loss suggested that the
operation had been least modified success because not single federal
shot had been fired and not single federal agent had been
took dead children get that new definition
one more the government claimed that they believed had automatic
weapons the
had license for the caliber machine
they knew damn well had they also knew had
without the element surprise they sent agents get
for all this president takes full what
hope gets
you absolving the batf fbi all blame this you should
aware two important
there such thing tear tear gas
remaining presence will cause nausea and followed eventually
siezures and did the fbi know the physical health all the people
they any potential heart problems among the
doubt dangerous stuff when
have you ever seen tear gas tear gas produced burning
chemical the the fumes produced are tear the canister has
warning printed the side with flamable material can result
how many these canisters did they throw inside building

	online bible but own system for the
search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly
that want break existing other
technically speaking christians should use saturday and not sunday
their holy they want conform the teachings
think the passage looking for the
matthew not that have come abolish the law and the
have come not abolish them but fulfil
matthew for say till heaven and earth pass
not not will pass from the law until all
matthew whoever then relaxes one the least these commandments
and teaches men shall called least the kingdom but
who does them and teaches them shall called great the kingdom
matthew for tell unless your righteousness exceeds that
the scribes and you will never enter the kingdom
there are several problems with the most serious that the
law was regarded jews the time binding but
not there are rules that were binding all human
beings noachic but they are quite the
issue that the church had face after death was what
about gentiles who wanted follow the decision not
impose the law them say that the law was
simply acknowledged that fact that apply this
simple which think just about everyone can agree
discussion the issue more less these terms recorded
acts
however more order get full picture the
role the have come grips with apparent
rejection the and how that relates commendation
the least read says that the law serves
purpose that has been certain sense this
issue one the abolition the the middle his
paul notes that might understood this and
assures that not what intends sees
the law primarily being present convict people their
but ultimately impossible and one that
has been superceded comments are not the
clearest and not everyone agrees with but the
interesting thing notice that even this radical position does
not entail abolition the still remains
uncompromising from which not iota dot may
for its purpose convicting important that not
however for not the end ultimately
live not
while the theoretical categories they use are rather the
end think jesus and paul come rather similar the
quoted passage from mat should taken the context the rest
the sermon the where jesus shows how interprets the
the iota would suggest rather literal
but fact not interpretations
emphasize the intent the and stay away from the ceremonial
indeed well known for taking rather free attitude
towards the sabbath and kosher some scholars claim that mat
needs taken the context jewish
jesus accuses his opponents caring about giving
tenth even the most minor but neglecting the things that
really mercy and and caring about how cups and
plates are but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full extortion and and
the discussion later mat suggest that jesus has very specific
view the law and that when talks about maintaining the
law its full thinking these aspects
conclusion while talks about the law being
all the specific examples gives involve the
such circumcision and the quite
concerned about maintaining moral
the net result this that when paul talks about the law being
and jesus talks about the law being believe
they are talking about different aspects the paul
embroiled arguments about natural letters
responding specific looking the aspect the
law that currently causing the law specifically jewish
certainly does not intend abolish divine standards
the other when jesus commends the seems
talking the law its broadest implications for morals and
human and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
give paul much
unfortunate that people use the same terms different but
should familiar with that from current look the
way terms like take special meaning from the
current imagine some poor historian the future trying
figure out why should used code word for
opposition homosexuality one specific period the
think law had taken similar role the arguments paul was
involved paul was clearly not rejecting all the jewish values

about the movement are really opposed family

disheartening increase willingness individual mormons engage the
same kinds stereotyping and even threats coercive

fearful irony that doing mormons take common cause with the
very people who have most slanderously attacked who
they had forcefully restrict rights along with those
others they believe

this but would certainly apply all who

	spite requiring scholarly opinion the hanging
rejects that the scholarly opinion the those scholars and then rephrases
those scholars opinion the
know from matthew that did hang himself and acts probably records
his although possible and plausible that fell from the hanging
and hit some thereby bursting can longer assume that
the matthew did not say judas died
result the did most scholars believe iprobably
quoted all that show that highly regard the but
looking the texts assume judas
highly
and
there nothing the greek suggest success simply
means
you further research the greek word you will
find that does denote those scholars did indeed have excellent
reason assume that the suicide was pointed
recently checked several
english lexicon the new louw and nida
greek and english lexicon the new
english lexicon the new grimm
study tynsdale
greek english lexicon the new testament and other
early christian
new analytical greek perschbacher
couple simply stated and couple were more explicit
and stated that means specifically yourself
couple also noted that the meaning one the root words for
throttle pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested david joslin that judas was hung upside one the best
references greek and english lexicon the new
not only stated the gave both the root the
literal related greek words which use the same and also
other presented specific examples the word greek literature give
further
the word has two root the and
the root word means literally this root words included
words which denote can mean transition place the
greek word means send can also denote
change state and specifically the change from life robinson
specifically makes comparison the word which means
literal meaning the word means strangle put out
the and implicitly denotes change life state away from
while the word does mean
specifically denotes death thus robinson quite specific when
state that means hang end life then
notes the the use homers odessy denote
presents that example being used explicitly mean
now since there perfectly good word for without the
added denotation and you insist that the bible was written
and every word precicely you are stuck with the complete
meaning since the word was then death
denoted the
the note that decenso also presents example
the septuagint greek translation the used the time
only used samuel when ahithophel saw that his advice
was not saddled and arose and went home his
his then put his household and hanged and
and was buried his
notice that not only stated that ahithophel
but explicitly here have doubt the
are not explicitly told judas
note you the septuagint was translation from hebrew
and you have not shown the original meaning the hebrew the the
hebrew say and thus whether was simply echoed the
should also pointed out regardless the added the
correct translation would still the man did indeed die from
strangulation but have evidence that the
septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited included versions
which contradicted each and such editing was not even necessarily
executed thus not sure that you can use the septuagint
now paragon ancient what you really need prove
your point ancient someone committing
and otherwise would see you simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding
now would note that everytime out way research
one your apparently contrived pretty much find
think that you are going add the something over and above
what the source clearly then you had better have explicit greek
historical source justify
the statement about trees around the
there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the
unless rose can show that these trees are two thousand years that
there are year old stumps has thousand year old description
the area which mentions such then inappropriate for him
assert that the present placement trees prove the location the trees two
thousand years ago things
now your other that the money judas used not the same
the
your second question you ask how could sure that the
money with which judas purchased the was indeed for the rather
than some other would point out that where specifically
mention reward also specifically mentions
what act iniquity they were talking about acts
judas who was guide those who arrested now would point out
that when the bible describes act and then immediately
discusses reward would rather inane suggest that
was action iniquity other than the one
notice that verse the word not states
that judas guide those who arrested
but the writer did not stop was numbered with and
obtained part this what part did judas play their
peter the author does not specifically call betrayal
but for that neither does john specifically call
actions further john did not say that judas took
the money but rather
thought that judas had the money jesus was telling
him what need for the that should give something
the after receiving the morsel immediately went and
was
note that said that judas does not say that took the money
thus when see your explanation still seems you would choose
the unproven mentioned another different
written different over the iniquity explicitly mentioned
the author find this forced and
course this particular argument becomes since have have seen
evidence that means you since hanging was
could not have spent the money mentioned john because
matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was the high holy day
and thus could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next thus the money which bought the would have
have been the pieces silver course got the pieces silver
that night and thus have spent that
believe that the house cards comming
maybe should this discuss now whether jesus was crucified
friday saturday that now part the argument about
the where the prophesy the field came from the

this with

	when are going hear christian answer this
what whose authority christians proclaim that they
are above the law and above the prophets major and and not
accountable the ten commandments which jesus clearly spoke his opinion
matthew what the source this who
the who the great
least one
jesus was not this context matthew makes
matt not think that came abolish the law
the did not come but jesus lived
under the jewish was the culmination the promises
the came the prophecies and fully obey
verse says truly say until heaven and earth pass
not the smallest letter stroke shall pass away from the
until all the key this verse imho the last
the fulfillment the what the
law was supposed
verse then annuls one the least these
and teaches shall called least the kingdom
but whoever keeps and teaches shall called great the
kingdom taken the context jesus teaching jewish
people about living lives under the this makes
appears that jesus responding some criticism
must have received about away with the that was not
intent had come earth live the law
should lived and fulfill the promises made god his
people all the way back eve serpent will bruise your
but will bruise his jesus appeared
away with the because did not honor the traditions men
equal the law regularly locked horns with the religious
leaders the day because would not conform only
the matthew passage jesus defending his dedication the law
and defending himself against his almost the entire sermon
the mount dedicated helping the jewish people
understand the true intent the sweeping away the clutter which
had been introduced the pharasees and their
galatians paul describes the relationship jesus the
law this
but before faith were kept custody under the being
shut the faith which was later therefore
the law has become our tutor lead that may
justified but now that faith has are
longer under for you are all sons god through faith
christ
believe this says that after christ was the law had
served tutor lead and
are longer under the law has been
christ said would
the author the old and the are the same
the old law and the new testament
will and are based the same moral
makes sense that many the principles the old law are
the other now that the law has fulfilled purpose and
christians relate god through not the also makes
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established
represent the this new baptism
representing and resurrection

	there were some recent developments the dispute about masonry among
southern posted summary over and
suppose that might useful note that not necessarily
agree disagree with any what present
for short southern baptist named larry holly wrote book
claiming that freemasonry religion incompatible with
father rejects and holly blames that the
the home missions board includes interfaith witness
which studies other religions and how teach them about few
years they were ordered produce report they concluded
that was not and therefore was outside their
holly led movement people who oppose and
last year the convention again ordered the hmb study got the
feeling that they were saying got the wrong answer last try
better and get the answer
been bit infighting and some inappropriate but
the dust has settled and the report nobody entirely happy with
but everybody seems willing live with both sides are saying things
such was the best were going get the current
the report commends the masons for the charity work they such the
hospitals and burn centers they well efforts help the
elderly and prevent drug the report acknowledges that many
known christians are and have been and notes that many teachings
masonry are christian faith and examples
the latter include belief emphases honesty and and
that some masonic lodges incorporate explicit christian
the other they note that some aspects masonry are incompatible
with southern baptist these included the use titles which some
people consider the taking certain oaths though they
are not meant the pagan writings
some masonic the implication some masonic writings that salvation
can achieved good and the racial discrimination practiced many
masonic note with some chagrin that baptist churches whole
really place speak this last
the report concludes that masonry not and says that membership
should not endorsed but left the discretion
this was part because there variation among different masonic
and while one may include elements strongly against another may
many southern baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood
the believer and the autonomy the local and this history probably
influenced how the report came
the information above was gleaned from religious publication
the baptist general association and which
does not have any direct links religious
big issue among some
because have neither the report nor whatever masonic documents are
relevant these none the above comes with your

	anderson replied letter
just something that you mentioned you refer
differing interpretations and say that many christians may
not that really not base our faith
how many people think one way the bottom line
regardless popularity
may you and personal beliefs should say
but relevant and many
bottom line independant from you anyone since you
proclaim may ask you what
authority you because says the the
bible someone who interprets whether
scripture doctrine conforms your particular liking
excuse but your line moved one bit persuade
that beliefs are all the
this you have struck member the wrecking
with positive message other saints
this entire discussion reminds lot the things said jesus
the preach about with your
but your hearts are far removed from
find rather strange that trying persuade that created
and eternally existent are you say the mormon
you grant your conclusion and then expect the point
have been order reply the you have address
and answer the point that was and not just jump the
conclusion that you
look you
that all you address your own regardless
whether come with any biblical scriptures which supports our points
because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
the bible states that lucifer was the bible states that jesus
the creator the contradiction that have that the lds
belief that jesus and lucifer were the
beautiful example disinformation and deliberate misrepresentation
lds the former kgb would have loved employ
jesus and lucifer are not and you know
the mormon belief that all are children there
nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible
the bible teaches that not everyone child
may contradict would you think the bible the bible
indeed does teach that not all are children god the sense that they
follow god his satan and his followers have
rebelled against and are not
but mean that they were not once created but chose
separate themselves from those who chose follow god and his plan
the field the the good seed are the children the
but the tares are the children the wicked
illustrates nicely what just the children the
kingdom are those who have remained valiant their testimony jesus
have shown and the children the
wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the the issue
those who followed has not been
addressed this and other verses you copied from your you
purposefully obscured the subject swamping your with
related
nice scriptures deleted robert
are told this life that they might know
thee the only true and jesus whom thou hast
life eternal know the only true yet the
doctrines the lds that have mentioned portray vastly
different jesus that cannot reconciled with the jesus
the they are far removed from each other that proclaim
jesus indeed different than your and can
reconciled with the jesus the your interpretation
but honestly care
one being true denies the other from being according the
eternal life dependent knowing the only true and
not the construct
this single posting seen more
than all the mails combined have read far this news
first get your straight before you dare preaching
about only true whom you interpret according your own likes
and but whose image cannot reconcile with what know about
him guess your grandiose does not allow for other
believing the divinity jesus but different
way fashion than your not that really the mission
and progress the lds church will boldly and and mob
opponent can stop the work from until has visited
every swept every and sounded every
this really red address any issue but
seeks the fact that some groups try read
something into the change what the bible
the bible the bible teaches according
robert weiss and respect the reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that have rejected the and
the respect your interpretations the even grant you
being christian your own image much
christian own image him
most the other replies have instead the issue
bruce mcconkie and whether his views were
think that matters views were that not the
were writings indicative mormon belief this
subject the real the indication from rick that they may
certainly
the issue that you love use anything either
represent ridicule the lds the issue
obviously very views have been controversial
seven deadly has made
erroneous worst not receive the priesthood this
respect him someone who has made his valuable
contribution the but personally not rely his personal
interpretations book oftentimes referred
mormon mormon rather
look official hugh
last comment mcconkie
was wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more the kingdom
god than but whose views are means dogma accepted
some clearly belongs personal interpretation and
but having said find mcconkie his most
biased and speculative far more than the
trash coming from your proverbial somewhat appalled that have
allowed myself sink low you this

chaney and reissued and
insecure about people reading your posts
that you feel the need write new posts announcing
what you wrote why accept
	while honestly believe you believe you are doing posting
that piece believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified their blatant persecution gay oriented
have seen the film called gay and along with church found
not because what was actually shown use
editting can create any image one wants rather becaseu are familia
familiar with how widely was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within the truth that neither
you nor can fully speak for anyone who calls themself but knowing
many and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
have say that the report you posted very biased something
obviously claimed against gays the truth that unless you are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are speak
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights our not
support wild sex any other misrepresentations perpetrated christian
fundamentalist but know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them mistake that the apa removed
homosexuality from list mental also mistake that
there are many christians and homophobes who long bring back the
not feel threatened understand why others
the following article concerning two the more popular
exodus international homosexuals
the founder support group chooses homo over hetero
robert pela gay oriented magazine
december david caligiuri received one the homophobia rewaa
the prayer day keeps the lust away director free
national caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians way out the homosexual
through like give the award caligiuri now
longer deserve
eight year involvement with the national movement peaked
with his founding the phoenix chapter homosexuals anonymous well
free has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the
gay movement fruitless effort based reality
was selling and product was
headed national ministries like exodus international and the
organizations the movement rely the tenents
christianity convince disatisfied homosexuals usually young gay men who
are just coming out that they can shed their sexuality suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing offer support people who are
seeking leave the sin explains bob director
ventures that those seeking abandon their
sexuality are
who involved the ministry misguided and wasting
their says lisa former who worked with
caligiuri and appeared with him the sally jessy raphael
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally
possible change your identity your says sex educator
brian author being really impossible
change your these people are longer calling themselves
but they continue have erotic
caligiuri says founded free indeed after ominous week when all
hell broke loose his personal few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business caligiuri was sexually assaulted
man picked was really
went home with this tied and raped left tied all
and the next morning raped
when caligiuri was eventually freed the returned home the
home shared with his had another man there with
caligiuri thought this this what being gay
want this way
caligiuri vowed that could find way would share his discovery
with organized antigay contingent demonstrate
gay pride parade june and few months later free indeed held its
first public meeting promote gay civil rights
free indeed members loudly blasted telling them ther were sinners headed
for
free indeed began receiving about hundred telephone calls thanks
part deceptive listing the local yellow were listed
under lesbian and gay alternative caligiuri people
thought were gay information people would call find out
where the local bars and preach them about the sins
ruses like this are typical the caligiuri
anything reach these
used radio and say really stupid recalls peter
counselor catholic diocese aids that
knew was gay when started wearing pastel
family first found out about his ministry when they saw him
syndicated talk show were
figured that they had have gay person the better
that should gay
but caligiuri was hardly the time appeared
started having sex with men men would call our hotline
and tell about thier latest sex with their sex with their
was horny all the
unable risk going gay where might recognized from his
numerous television caligiuri says bookstores
and get when working the was sleeping
with other
realize but lot the leaders were having sex
with one caligiuri conferences other
and paired hotel everybody was sleeping with everybody
the time appeared television show may
caligiuri was having anonymous sex couple times when the
host asked him ever his answer was
duplicity began take toll was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and dibilitating
yeast and this led his escape from the was too sick
more time spent away from those people
the more began feel like began remember who used
late caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over local
church and closed the convinced myself that there
need the world for
studying alternative spiritualities
belief systems that considering romance
not with and searching for new project devote himself
feel compelled commit myself gay want
eventually stop feeling guilty about what did and make for the damage
may have brought our
tory means unique and have read several other articles
former leaders and founders ministries who have said very similar
similar fortuantely not all them have left but have
come realize that god loves them despite the attitudes
like chris director the presbyterian west
hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community
bring them into the sheepfold christ and encouraging real ethical values
sexuality within the sphere being have said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups
and who either once claimed have been who
were too honest with themselves live matter who was disappointed
some were even encouraged marry way their
new only eventually start hitting the bathhouses
and since these were usually activities under the concealment
night and promiscuous behavior meant continuous
through committed this horrible trap which the church
has dumped the backs the truly gay oriented and the very
cent victims these cases are the wives and children such yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing allow
gay heterosexuality this what also
the cases those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity such mixed confusion that the church forces
they may even opt for surgical dampering the brain
the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were
there are now becoming available more and more literature the
threat coercive christianity toward such sylvia
there are and there are also great many fact
based books being written help people trapped this confusion such
maury under and chris
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and

its this was the momentum behind the spanish only all
they required was confession faith much and

the first accusations homosexuality the came from outside the nazi
long before the nazis ever came this objection red
even established history wrong this none
the histories read ever made mention hitler anyone else ever using
homosexuality pretext for purging point saw reiterated was that
hitler and the party covered these you are going accuse
official history being you should least get your facts
the pretext for purging roehm was that was planning use the
coup against nowhere there mention using allegations
homosexuality pretext for the nor justification afterwards
possible that the histories read have not mentioned but doubt
would best interest admit the world that his
former right hand man was
said always possible that have missed references
the nazis making use charges homosexuality against the after the
night the long knives but this does not prove that they were even
the nazis could tell the truth when was their any
this does not deal with accusations homosexuality the during the
the accusers thereafter controlled the
bearing the subject true not has considered
forgot this was being posted can smell the
paranoia from since the nazis never officially charged roehm with
homosexuality not according what like know
what tainted you are talking since the accusations were made
persons outside the nazi long before came and those
accusations were common knowledge journalists and others germany the
and just how would possible for the nazis back
time and plant how exactly does one doctor newspapers
which were circulated around the without the discrepancies being
what actual incidences nazi doctoring evidence this matter
you know and what about the testimony people who were involved
these some whom were not and what the point making
false accusation homosexuality you not publicize since the point
here seems discredit established then the burden proof
falls the the revisionists had better their homework
before making otherwise they simply look like conspiracy
available data suggest that roehm and his
left the world better
when they
this just about the thing agree
suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people roehm and
his buddies who were homosexuals must disturb some the feeling
seems that nasty individual accused that this
must attempt bash this fear often justified what
lies behind this distrust official seems but this
not good justification for trashing accepted accounts this
you really think that historians are why you write them
and ask where they got their sources this you tell from
their graduate student writing professors and
tracking down sources old but time limited and this not
specialty and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred doubt existing not going waste time
trying debunk the research
concrete particulars are still more than
less shrewd
diccon frankborn
given that you already consider all evidence what earth would
constitute concrete and since when have concrete particulars been
considered
suggest that those who not trust popular historians
historians writing for popular audience provide copious
footnotes should try instead reading academic who usually
provide footnotes all their sources immmense this the place
start assuming that one really wants know the
bet the folks are tired this subject
apologies seem have gone off bit forget which gods
are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject
the eternal moods the bleak the gods speak softly
days
	lot religious opinions and quotations from the bible and from
many catholic theologians and papal bulls
although introduced with was not funny
might have been subject headers such
dick instrument
and the posting seemed more vehicle for the
religious text than for any
surprised and would expect this kind behavior
from the evangelical
but have always thought
that catholics behaved better than
friend urge you follow the example your fellow
who count many dozens and practice
your faith through good example and decent living and respect
for the common humanity please not stoop the
level the who think
that the best way witness
insulting and overbearingly
the imagery the song solomon little bit dated
middle east date palms never but apparently
steaminess accepted part the from
this fact derive that erotica itself not incompatible with
catholic
there such thing catholic not necessarily love
story between people that but love story that not
does not seek redemption through penis pays
proper respect the dignity each and still erotic
enough have place
would submit that the series stories also
most the and and
would guess that your aim cut down the pornography and
increase the actually agree with you that nearly all
the got enormous and shot wad all over her
stories are count them which makes take the
ration much lower than many other
since you are one the few posters here who can actually write
decent could you write few stories for instead
overwhelming with
this big please add your
additions and
dennis
thank
jeff

	there are few groups that continue believe christians have
worship the sabbath the are the
adventists and they argue that act not
regular worship but special meeting see paul and
that cor explicitly say regular worship
witnesses not believe that christians are required observe
the whether saturday the sabbath was part
covenent between god and the israelites and not required for
steve peterson
	the observation that the tree life would rotate clockwise the
northern hemisphere and counterclockwise the southern probably
give enough consideration the feebleness the coriolis force compared
the phototropism much more likely explanation
the classic that the clockwise swastika the because

historical way clocks were first made little imitation
images the sun moving thru the more valid talk
the clock going but the engineers listen course
there still much uncertainty about whether the

but not going try settle that one just
	say that science has its basis values bit
science has its basis observable
say that what one chooses observe and how the observation
interpreted and what significance given depends great deal
the values the science human activity and
subject the same potential for distortion any other human
the myth that scientists are above moral influence
ethical that their knowledge can abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted the biases the
bill
one argue for objective values moral then one must
first start demonstrating that morality itself considering
the meaning the word doubt that this will ever
back the original
and objective morality
this may unfortunate choice almost
objective the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior some group
the first term all the second the
concept supposedly described may have meaning
there god described the christians then
has existence apart from and independent his
existence outside our frame reference this
being declares thing since has
defined himself omnipotent his claims are
least omnipotent relative god intrinsically
and all reality whatever says
objective
god determines standard that standard
human beings are held accountable for their conformance that
standard while permitted ignore they substitute relative
morality mode giving the term morality
meaningless sense that can argued about those pretending
the standard objective and the conduct required
meet that standard therefore objectively
just because convenient pretend that the term morality
infinitely mean that the objective standard itself
morality has come mean little more than cultural
the preferred conduct making seem
but derived from
this objective standard perfect accord with our true
nature christianity yet condemned being
contrary human oppressive and this may due
bill
much our amoral inclinations the standard but like
	will clarify earlier laws were originally written for
the jesus changed that fact now making the law applicable
all not just the gentiles could part the kingdom
heaven through the saving grace never said that the law was made
obsolete
just for the earlier
and deuteronomy
these laws written for the chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest the the israelites were
direct witness disobey god after knowing that god
real would outright denial god and therefore immediately
these laws were written for different time and applied only
chosen but jesus has changed all are living
the age sin longer immediately punishable there
repentance and there salvation through our lord jesus and
not just for few chosen salvation available jew
and gentile
these are two conflicting say one clarification the
other breach mind people shifting their position
irritates when said under the premise that change
was what about deuteronomy wrong did jesus
change
clarified the law such that quote you the
following jesus takes several portions the law and expounds upon
the law giving clearer meaning what god
sure does address the notion stoning
because this needs are you going
deny that deuteronomy not patently clear its
think you will agree with that there are lot
pharisees who know the bible from end end but not believe
what good head knowledge there nothing the
agree that there lot modern day pharisees that know the bible
from end end and believe depending how they use this
they can they can argue any position they and
back with selected parts the such pharisees include david
koresh and adolph will qualify this saying
they actually believed what they were but the ends certainly
made the means look
just scary are those that know much the but
believe every this probably since there are far
more these from what they are very easy
manipulate the aforementioned since they know enough
debate with these
christianity not just set lifestyle that changes
perspectives and personal and demands obedience
demands obedience god came down and personally told
how should then would say that would doing will
doing and evangelists tell
obey the will book written people who have been dead for close
two millenia longer for the even follow everything
with could scarcely honest with myself saying doing
the will
some people can live but many others cannot will that
their choice and have respect because god respects
god respects how come there talk the bible about
eternal damnation for see little respect eminating from
the god the see selfish and spiteful
god with
not thanks

and for the here earlier
for book that only applied the israelites jesus sure
quoted lot alludes several
other places just case
clear jesus thought the old testament repeat the
verse matthew which gets quoted this group
not think that have come abolish the law the have
not come abolish them but fulfill tell you the until
heaven and earth not the smallest not the least stroke
will any means disappear from the law until everything
anyone who breaks one the least these commandments
and teaches others the same will called least the kingdom
but whoever practices and teaches these commands will called
great the kingdom for tell you that unless your
righteousness surpasses that the pharisees and the teachers the
you will certainly not enter the kingdom
pretty red that you know jesus
this causes serious dilemma for christians who think the old testament
apply think why paul harvey likes quoting

you can explain why the death jesus was
would very glad hear and you might even convert
that heard all the most common arguments
and they just convince
jesus himself said why john
mystery anyone and there certainly need for
persuasive read own reply your
john say unless grain wheat
falls onto the ground and remains but
produces much
who loves his life will lose and who hates his life
this world will keep for eternal
anyone serves let him follow and where there
servant will anyone serves him father will
why would want eternal life hate this
were created why would that deity not wish
enjoy what has given
why would want live the challenge life that
will and that must give life the meaning wish have
before that time here and will someday will
content live the memories and once they too
are then will longer have any reason
even your deity that automatically
mean that would worship content live own and
fend for when can proud the fact that
matter where end will because actions and
your god decides toss into flaming pit for then
would much rather just cease but your god wants
respect and then had better earn and
then they will very strong and
gives more reasons john but one obvious reason
jesus with everything has nothing with
was that could rise life that
would doubting and the fact
jesus rose from the dead hope that too will rise
the obvious not overlook
this obvious would have hope
faith would
jesus the only one who rose from the dead think was
osiris who did the well few characters from greek
norse memory
but why would want rise from the why want
did jesus suffer his ask jesus
why john mystery
hates him without direct proclamation
how far humans botch things and how much
your god wants win then knows what can
provide some way for believe without having resort blind
faith that could applied equally well any
why brian accept how can
cannot accept him because neither sees him nor knows
precisely neither see nor know zeus nor
shall offer them the same devotion offer
animosity and the lack knowledge
comes out your twistings daily verses
convincing testimony the truth john and
got understand see christians spouting
bible verse all the time were some sort magic spell that
will level all truth robert has never
demonstrated that actually understands what the verses
just rattles them off day some brazenly fly the face
common sense and and point these out where
but even more than even when christians try explain the
verses their own they from christian point
which that every human being would want christian only
she understood the christian message and then all
strife and suffering the earth would the problem with
substitute instead
and means the same
christanity very nice belief set around very nice but
you want make believe that has any bearing the real
got some convincing
pray and hope that blurt out such animosity and lack
not perfect but regardless thank
that jesus revealed himself without whom also
about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
who created and who loves

descendant suppose you prove
encyclopedia mircea eliade
later eschatology and apocalyptics were fertile meeting
ground for iranian and can seen the famous
work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning the christian probably the
second century the zoroastrian doctrine the savior
the future was the basis for the story the coming the magi
bethlehem the
the old persian word rendered greek uncertain
may originally have meant the the
avestan compound member the this meaning
would have been further among the the priestly
and perhaps the term
probably median given that herodotus mentions the one
the six tribes the
for variety reasons can consider the magi have been members
priestly tribe median origin western among the they were
responsible for liturgical well for maintaining their
knowledge the holy and the most the supremacy the median
priesthood western iran became established during the time the median
monarchy that dominated the persians from the end the eighth century
through the first half the sixth century bce until the revolt cyrus the
great the persians were indebted the medes for their political
and civil institutions even hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence magi persian origin the achaemenid period
must still maintain that they were median this
demonstrated the eposide the revolt gaumata the mentioned
darius the inscription bisutun well
greek herodotus insists the idea the usurpatory power
the medes against the persians through the conspiracy the
the fact that the magi may have been members tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some them undertook secular this seems
attested the elamite tablets
there put forth giuseppe that denies that the magi
are members ethnic group suggesting that they are simply members
the priesthood priesthood purely zoroastrian this thesis
the other the hypothesis that their name related the
avestan term derived from the gathic maga
not without foundation the meaning maga can probably
conformity with the pahlavi within the context the concept
separation the the two opposed principles spirit
and the which has been erroneously interpreted from
the root which said mean the magic and
has been rendered simply expression like unio seems
ecstatic condition that opens the mind spiritual any though
there may relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan terms
magavan and must maintain clear distinction between the magi and the
avestan the avesta ignores the median old persian despite
recent hypothesis proposed old persian inscriptions ignore
the avestan term for athravan even this
perhaps present achaeminid setting the elamite tablets persepolis
the term magu has been present zoroastrianism throughout its the
pahlavi terms and mobad represent its the latter
particular derives from older magupati the during
the sasanid period seventh centuries which saw the formation
hierarchically organized the title mobadan mobad high priest
high came used designate the summit the ecclesiastical
the magi practiced consanguineous khvaetvadatha
they also performed characteristic funeral the exposure
the corpse animals and vultures remove the flesh and thereby cleanse
the corpse was not supposed lest contaminated the demons
this practice later became typical the entire zoroastrian
community and led the rise complex funeral ritual iran and among the
parsis stone known were built especially for this
during the time herodotus the practice exposure the corpse was
vogue only among the the persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
then buried the practice was among the peoples
central
the magi were the technicians and experts was impossible
offer sacrifices without the presence during the performance
ritual the magus sang the theogony magi were possibly the
custodians tradition sacred but know nothing about the
relationship this tradition the various parts the and was
called upon interpret dreams and divine the the magi were also
known for the practice killing animals
such snakes and they dressed the median wearing
and coats with they wore characteristic head covering
felt with strips the sides that could used cover the nose
and mouth during rituals avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath the color these conformity with tradition
that probably according georges was
that the
all during the achaemenid period the magi were not
possession body and probable that they
gradually adopted they were most likely clergy consisting
professional priests who were not tied rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined eclecticism and they must have been
jealous guardians the patrimony zorastrian virtue this
they were the educators the royal the wisest them was responsible
for teaching the prince the son and thus
the the magi who excelled other virtues were entrusted with
the education the prince that would learn and
master
during the achaemenid period the magi maintained position great
although they were certainly subordinate the despite
several dramatic events such the massacre they suffered after the death
gaumata the magian according herodotus calls himself
the persians killed large number magi avenge the usurpation
the magi nevertheless managed maintain their influence court
and the various regions the empire where they were stationed
consequence the persian civilian and military
priesthood antiquity was more famous than that the they were
renowned followers zarathushtra the teachers some
the greatest greek thinkers the wise men
who guided the manger the newborn savior
and the propagators cult the sun but they were
also known the the priesthood known for its
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had pejorative sense
like the magic and the
chaldeans were experts all types magical especially and
had reputation for wisdom well
understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant
necessary distinguish between the magi iran proper and the
western who were later the achaemenid period both must
have been least part but the western magi the
iranian diaspora asia and who came
contact with diverse religious must sooner later and
varying been influenced syncretic
the greeks were familiar with both kinds magi depending their
varying would emphasize one the other aspect classical
historians and including herodotus and document their
while the philosophers dwell above all their
belief the magian cosmology and and their theology
and those sources most interested the doctrines the magi
even speak zarathushtra doing they are repeating what the
magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid when they adopted
that time they embraced zarathushtra one their own and
placed themselves under his venerable
zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations the
eastern community the time the acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements the archaic religion that refused has been said quite
attempt characterize the precise role the magi the
zoroastrian that the vendidad
part the should attributed collection
texts from various periods primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
the hypothesis hardly since the first
chapter the vendidad list sixteen lands created ahura the
supreme god but contaminated attack ahriman
angra the other supreme god and the ultimate source
all evil and suffering does not mention western media
land ragha mentioned the text cannot median
has been noted that the authors had been magi the
absence any reference western iranian including their own
would very
the magi were above all the means which the zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus the avesta have been transmitted from the second half the
first millennium bce this has been their principal can attribute
directly the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism known
especially from greek sources from the pahlavi literature
the ninth and tenth centuries according this the two poles
the dualism are the spenta mainyu
and angra mainyu but ahura mazda himself and angra
mainyu ahura mazda and angra this
formation was immense consequence for the historical development
astrianism and was most likely determined the contact the magi with the
mesopotamian religious this new dualism which was that later known
the greeks eudemus and can
see the affirmation new current thought within which
give the name
thanks their adherence the magi played enormously
important role the transmission well
the definition the new forms that these would assume their
natural propensity eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion
zoroastrian ideas the communities the iranian the greeks began
study their doctrines and take interest them
even writing treatises
the persian which only the titles and few fragments have
the hellenistic the magi were seen secular school
and writings and alchemy were lent the authority
such prestigious names and forming
abundant apocryphal and
later eschatology and apocalyptics were fertile meeting

most likely dates from the beginning the christian probably the
second century the zoroastrian doctrine the savior

bethlehem the

here you have asked the big

really contentious this reply your final
not was just wondering you subscribed some
school thought and and
you had have been interested hear
thoughts falls roughly line with john stuart mill and
his writings have particular plan
bit personal ethics and social opinion what
that the authority for each moral must increased and that this
will probably take several generations think that the
list morals has changed for society though the authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models eric berne and his
transactional analysis work mavis for and this what
gives rise deterioration moral standards the long
had some more thoughts
was thinking that should add moral character the list definitions
order get dynamic version the moral nature the interplay
the moral code and associated suitable analogy might
graphic equaliser hifi system the moral nature being the set
frequencies and the chosen and the moral character being the
spectrum over
conscience little more difficult because define the
reasoning person between actions the context his moral nature
because conscience seems cut most the time unbidden and often
think conscience manifest when decision made given
time which compromises moral conscience fits more with

after surviving being driven out and later
mormons did fortify they still arm themselves the
and stockpile food they have been involved quite
illegal activity including multiple often wives
the leaders practice still vogue with some splinters their
the parallels between koresh and joseph smith are
you mean the leaders the lds grant you that when
joseph smith was still plenty were most
which had little bearing with evidenced various
have studied lds history for years and have yet see prove
that the lds leadership was
plural but your charge wives sounds like
could have originated from and discredits the high moral
standards which characterized these leaders and
those david
joseph smith started the after and his brother hyram
murdered jail church membership split over
smith was considered prophet like
rather interesting parallel considering muslims consider
prophet the same led make
this was messiah talking about the
and neither did claim the church reflects the moral
aptitude its leaders especially those joseph have
nothing but the highest respect for this inspired whose only
was that refused deny that had seen many have tried
explain the but the bold presence
million member strong church stands witness that joseph
testimony had enough resilience and power carry the
the time was that the gift prophecy was handed
father after joseph smith his son was only
his brigham young and few others claimed have
bequeathed the gift and leadership prior his the
the church governing much help
and this basic conflict still wedge between the
young took his followers salt the rest waited
smith grow enough assume the other
the leadership were soon like mike
were apostates and excommunicated members the
while the great majority the the and the various
auxiliary chose accept brigham young the new
prophet and leader the you knew your lds scriptures and
you would have known that brigham young was the first
line fill the prophet joseph was the senior
apostle the and various comments made joseph indicated
that was brigham who would lead the exodus the
other rightful were either dead excommunicated
and while persecutions abounded and
joseph smith had already given orders look for new empty
land beyond the boundaries the united states that this
principle was well understood and antipated
the great majority lds and was not questioned
couple stayed unwilling
sacrifice and undertake the perilous journey the but
this also was necessary separate the tares from the the
church benefitted from this purification they became even
more unified and willing carry out their mission the
both sects practiced the food
this being frontier and farming country most carried
owned there little evidence that they were
given that they tended move rather than

was far beyond where even the army and these people

since when the church jesus christ saints
the largest denominations the
from any other did the southern baptists
what did the mormons seems that edgar hoover was very
with the way they kept pledged defend
with their lives and atone for sin with many actually
even the point
what suicide sinful and against the law
not comfortable with this alleged with assure you
that among reject this attitude our
only true allegiance our god and the leaders which has
appointed represent any read this trash
suicide and for sins with yet another insulting
misrepresentation what church believes and stands
the the reorganized are friendly rivals the lds
delight telling stories about which generates quick retorts
the lds members and everybody has grand time have
ever even heard this hinted taking with salt
make really big salt mountain with glacier
hired virtually one but
until the fbi was almost exclusively staffed members the
later day though edgar finally the fbi
the field are still heavily
have often wondered how this might affect the treatment
religious organizations mormon would consider
even this were true
convinced that those officers would perform the highest codes
honor and conduct why they were selected for the
first one our articles faith
strongly states the principle freedom and that all
people are free worship they
there would little lds and rlds
that all other religions have strayed from the true
set down but that god will judge each his
the rlds also contend the lds may
that ignorance the true way you
only condemned you had been tought the way and rejected
lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans
secure the knowledge that though they are wrong they
not penalized for more likely that hoover
them because their rather strict upbringings which forbade
hot drink coffee and the
people are the the and such are more
made follow orders and have few vices used against
good can accept you are right that lds people
are sometimes little too cosy with late

now amorc embroiled some internal political
guess the san jose mercury news wrong and why the
	going try something that perhaps many would
not have thought even want begin the process
initiating literary critical study the pornography posted
identify the major themes and motifs present
the stories posted there opening then the possibility
objective moral evaluation the material present
first let congratulate you for not posting flame about sick
you are you are all going which seems the
usual post found the you
get
you argued personally think that your project
built unsteady
not believe that there any way find
morality and value are inherently subjective they represent the beliefs
person group they can widely perhaps even
overwhelmingly but they are never and never
christian bedrock assumption that all that comes
truly from
regarding while perhaps even from
objective the majority its material indeed
repugnant come this conclusion quite quickly when you
start thinking about analyzing its material like some
reflects some fairly profound needs people well some
truths and deserve pointed
not accept the assumptions that you make you
you are trying then why accept morality begin with
using the christian defeating your own purpose doing
the long the advantage making such
analysis that will save between christians and
non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability
the stuff these
call but you stop the there will always
people who pop upin tell how sick and twisted and evil
all just out readers show unprovoked the
religion groups tell you all that you are
overbearing
there should not dissonance between
morality and either there value
particular there not whether one christian
let provide four people get together over
discuss rather conservative and
start off saying that think immoral force people have sex with
you but also say that immoral have sex with someone
your own really know your views
just using this common view morality for the
purposes this the moslem says that immoral for women
have their faces
the who has become kills all three and eats but
feels guilt because has done nothing wrong morally his own
support for the first
the christian scriptures say
not going accept your evidence for you ask accept word
that everything good comes from this only valid argument for
person who shares your
must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs erotica could
interesting for other reasons than good luck with this next
now then what are some the major the
pornographic literature places like these
are some that been able please
motif the
many the stories there expressed feeling
alienation and worthlessness the part the writer
otherwise protagonist the story with regard the object
other often story involves
protagonist who the quite average underneath
usually has enormous who desires some way gain
access definitely sexual the other person who
confesses far more desireable than and who
indeed seems walk between the
detect just wee bit condescence
motif celebration preoccupation
not very
the vast majority pornographic literature deals with
innocence about simply
physical and most people christian non
will say that beauty
one could construe this mean that beautiful people are
than would hope that people relize that this
not necessarily
motif dick instrument
might suggest the word seems more line with the tone
your
blessed are those who are for they shall get
from what would thus revised matthew
respect you and your sense
motif sex expression sincere
there often clear desire the part the
give pleasure the object
and this theme usually what the better stories are
they are not always selfish could point examples the work elf
for
motif describes sex which completely
removed from the realm
removed sex from its procreative dimension
that one begins wonder why sex even involves
the context described pornography serves
then real
serves the same purpose does pornographic affirms the
virility the male well assuring the reader that
has
the whole picture probably very well described the
catholic teaching the husband and act
total mutual the sexual cooperating with
god opening themselves for the transmission new life
humane
your whole picture unfortunately only applies people who accept your
sex for then
did god make that people would want
rather than building
did god make not every sexual encounter results
even among does this mean that they have
any case and the catholic teaching will
probably not see eye eye this for long
motif sex used instrument power and
why pornography seems tend that really not
probably volumes could written the relationships
between sex and but this probably gives good
reason why traditionally has been negative
with regard sexuality seems tend great moral
pornography would not tend those directions there were not demand for
many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out real
but will think about and read about and mull

just something that you mentioned you refer
differing interpretations and say that many christians may
not that really not base our faith
how many people think one way the bottom line
regardless popularity
may you and personal beliefs should say
but relevant and many
bottom line independant from you anyone since you
proclaim may ask you what
authority you because says the the
bible someone who interprets whether
scripture doctrine conforms your particular liking
excuse but your line moved one bit persuade
that beliefs are all the
this you have struck member the wrecking
with positive message any other
this entire discussion reminds lot the things said jesus
the preach about with your
but your hearts are far removed from
find rather strange that trying persuade that created
and eternally existent are you say the mormon
you grant your conclusion and then expect the point
have been order reply the you have address
and answer the point that was and not just jump the
conclusion that you
look you
that all you address your own regardless
whether come with any biblical scriptures which supports our points
because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
the bible states that lucifer was the bible states that jesus
the creator the contradiction that have that the lds
belief that jesus and lucifer were the
beautiful example disinformation and deliberate misrepresentation
lds the former kgb would have loved employ
jesus and lucifer are not and you know
the mormon belief that all are children there
nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible
the bible teaches that not everyone child
may contradict would you think the bible the bible
indeed does teach that not all are children god the sense that they
follow god his satan and his followers have
rebelled against and are not
but mean that they were not once created but chose
separate themselves from those who chose follow god and his plan
the field the the good seed are the children the
but the tares are the children the wicked
illustrates nicely what just the children the
kingdom are those who have remained valiant their testimony jesus
have shown and the children the
wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the the issue
those who followed has not been
addressed this and other verses you copied from your you
purposefully obscured the subject swamping your with
related
nice scriptures deleted robert
are told this life that they might know
thee the only true and jesus whom thou hast
life eternal know the only true yet the
doctrines the lds that have mentioned portray vastly
different jesus that cannot reconciled with the jesus
the they are far removed from each other that proclaim
jesus indeed different than your and can
reconciled with the jesus the your interpretation
but honestly care
one being true denies the other from being according the
eternal life dependent knowing the only true and
not the construct
this single posting seen more
than all the mails combined have read far this news
first get your straight before you dare preaching
about only true whom you interpret according your own likes
and but whose image cannot reconcile with what know about
him guess your grandiose does not allow for other
believing the divinity jesus but different
way fashion than your not that really the mission
and progress the lds church will boldly and and mob
opponent can stop the work from until has visited
every swept every and sounded every
this really red address any issue but
seeks the fact that some groups try read
something into the change what the bible
the bible the bible teaches according
robert weiss and respect the reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that have rejected the and
the respect your interpretations the even grant you
being christian your own image much
christian own image him
most the other replies have instead the issue
bruce mcconkie and whether his views were
think that matters views were that not the

subject the real the indication from rick that they may

the issue that you love use anything either
represent ridicule the lds the issue
obviously very views have been controversial
seven deadly has made
erroneous worst not receive the priesthood this
respect him someone who has made his valuable
contribution the but personally not rely his personal
interpretations book oftentimes referred
mormon mormon rather
look official hugh
last comment mcconkie
was wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more the kingdom
god than but whose views are means dogma accepted
some clearly belongs personal interpretation and
but having said find mcconkie his most
biased and speculative far more than the

mean that you can find ridiculous the rest
are supposed conclude that objectively correct price
said nothing about the asked the deal was
was complete that how does coming
with derisory deal tell anything about the existence
asking accept that the deal you offered would turned

differing interpretations and say that many christians may
not that really not base our faith
how many people think one way the bottom line
regardless popularity
thought were discussing assumed that heresy
meant departure from which case generally accepted belief
indeed important this the definition the word
great since creation the issue being
find rather strange that trying persuade that created

you grant your conclusion and then expect the point
have been order reply the you have address
and answer the point that was and not just jump the
conclusion that you
should have said the mormon you disagree with the

belief that jesus and lucifer were the
you interpret the bible mean something very specific
such
the mormon belief that all are children there
nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible
the bible teaches that not everyone child
always cracks when presume tell mormons what they
mormons believe that all including christ and
are children god the sense that were all created
organized also believe that being
god has symbolic sense when applied being spiritually
thus the same word can used convey different this
how language and why making someone offender for

this really red address any issue but
seeks the fact that some groups try read

first look the bible see what not
even what the bible teaches because there are some groups that
have differing views see what the bible
you have look the
the not red herring all show that those
who rely wholly the bible cannot seem agree what you say
that one must simply the see what but centuries
people doing just that have that one really sure what
are believe that you are the only one who really understands the
find this rather when mentioned that the mormon belief

	you who say that immoral for onesself experience
hurt some other maybe but that
anything about

can derive the immorality hurting someone else entirely from selfish
can for that wrong hurt other people
that makes them less productive members
making someone less productive member society
you are screwing morality does not say does
define only and also defines social
without any overtones good and picking your trash
not really moral issue the eternal sense good

execute that idea just because they want
simply because let people make their minds about what morals they
have prevent from spotting and stopping madman when see

want interfere lives even when they affecting
central character crime and
something reasoned that killed this old jewish woman and
her money educate and establish himself could
great contribution reasoned that she was not

one the central points any moral system that
has internally
killing the character had accept the premise that the ends
justify the accepted that then order
must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard his unwilling accept
this premise will not willing then has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral
example
suppose freshman the bench will only get play one the
the the court injured this freshman
play the big game talent scout can see hurts
player the might slightly lessen the chances the team
but might gain great personal operating purely
arranges for sniper shoot
player the gets play front the talent
that freshman behave
intentions may sometimes generate moral but
two problems right off the
the problem with your analogy that address the goal
that started winning the playing front the talent
scout winning the try creating the same analogy and keep the
ultimate goal the will
the internal consistency question also not the freshman
wants this other then has accept the fact that
may happen him one then has violated
his own moral

each case the meaning the word chorion was given variously
bit and similar
nowhere any these books mention anything about some these
books into great would very surprised find that these books
are all inadequate and archer the only competent scholar
think more likely that investigations into

again shown worthless expert witness the way would
have honorably presented results this even had found them

the among these the definition
the word used matthew describe the field the word
defined field the chorion specifically noted
synonym this evidence how silly
exegisis which stated that the word for matthew
different from the word for acts and
thus must talking about two different fields course you already
admit how stupid exegisis but this was small serendipity
which drives the point
unless decenso show compelling reasons believe otherwise
reputable scholar with reputable consider this

	there has been lot discussion about ezekiel prophesied
that the place would mashed and never there are lot
people living would appear that ezekiel was not literally
this bother because understand the language ezekiel used
differently than biblical for sometimes
happens that someone says grandson the cutest and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says she the cutest
this person not literally claiming have lined all the babies the
world according cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
trying express his emotions using words that are very
because this example one that common many
nobody misunderstands the intent the the
often the mercy people who assume that everything within must exactly
literally for those the existence tyre for
turning the latest person trying defend read this from
john
the prophesy clearly implies that people would still living the
implies nothing the you had nothing but the prophecy from
and you were told you interpret you would never say
means that there will houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like you would read will make you bare and will never
and conclude that tyre would bare the only way
get from and buildings and
you know that all that latter stuff
other your answer means that ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy the time was there way given literal
they could read this passage and conclude
you seem feel that means maybe but
hardly
king also
far seen stated figurers ranging from
assume the latter one modern standards
are talking about
only bit less than the population where
you the naval the state george washington
resigned his commission the annapolis may not new but
least
but supposing people still people
more than ezekiel
and said nothing about the other chapter ezekiel
predicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their
nebuchadnezzar did not destroy and chapter
ezekiel even quotes god saying and his army got reward from the
campaign led against
ignore alexander for and just pay attention chapter
ezekiel says would destroy and did not destroy ezekiel says
that would plunder their but did not plunder their
regardless what you think about tyre the fact that died before
the place was ezekiel said was going and did
this post inerrantists have amazing ability
rewrite the bible needed fit whatever they want
for expect king respond the comments about ezekiel
pulling some out
when ezekiel said that would your that clearly implied
that the walls would still standing people would know where the towers
used and when ezekiel said that would your fine houses
and throw your timber and rubble into the that clearly implied
that would never set foot the and when ezekiel wrote that
would ramp your that clearly implies that would
spend years stomping around the mainland and never get close the
few that are totally contrary the and
you can reconcile anything you
you know why the because you demand cliff claven

think that discussions this nature are not completely out
happening that that the term becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words

	those who think david koresh have solid
sound biblical backing for his hour long tape
enclosed partial list the sources cites quotes
exactly christian pretty not
david koresh was born bethlehem
	rick anderson replied letter
heretical few the first point that
this equates lucifer and jesus being the same type
lucifer created perfect thy
ways from the day that thou wast till iniquity was found
while jesus and the creator
all the beginning was the and the word was with
and the word was the same was the beginning with
all things were made and without him was not any thing made
that was before all and
him all things
your inference from the ezekiel and john passages that lucifer was
and that jesus was not depends particular interpetation
the word one with which many christians may not
granted the mormon belief that all children christ
and are eternally existent intelligences which were
into spirit children the term can apply equally well
both those
just something that you mentioned you refer
differing interpretations and say that many christians may
not that really not base our faith
how many people think one way the bottom line
regardless popularity
find rather strange that trying persuade that created
and eternally existent are you say the mormon
you grant your conclusion and then expect the point
have been order reply the you have address
and answer the point that was and not just jump the
conclusion that you
the bible states that lucifer was the bible states that jesus
the creator the contradiction that have that the lds
belief that jesus and lucifer were the
your point that all are brothers jesus and lucifer also
since are not innately brothers and sisters
are have not received the spirit bondage
again but have received the spirit whereby
and not the natural children
only through faith that even enter the family
are all the children god faith christ
and only through the manifestation this
faith receiving jesus that are become the sons
many received them gave power become the sons
them that believe his which were not
nor the will the nor the will but
has occured that being someone being
that person may symbolic term the new
mormons believe that are into the house
israel through baptism and faith although some have expressed
belief that this does evince physical change our
the mormon belief that all are children there
nothing symbolic about this contradicts what the bible
the bible teaches that not everyone child
the field the the good seed are the children the
but the tares are the children the wicked
speak that which have seen with and that which
have seen with your
the deeds your then said they not
born have one jesus said
unto god were your would love for
proceeded forth and came from neither came but
sent why not understand because
cannot hear are father the and the
lusts your father will was murderer from the

when speaketh speaketh his for
and the father
and full all subtilty and all child
the enemy all wilt thou not cease
pervert the right ways the
wherein time past walked according the course this
according the prince the power the the spirit
that now worketh the children
this the children god are and the children the
whosoever doeth not righteousness not neither
that loveth not his john
one becomes child
but many received them gave power become the
sons them that believe his
what manner love the father hath bestowed upon that
should called the sons therefore the world knoweth
because knew him now are the sons
and doth not yet appear what shall but know when
shall shall like for shall see him

which were not nor the will the nor
the will but
having predestinated unto the adoption children jesus
christ according the good pleasure his
his own will begat with the word that should

for have not received the spirit bondage again
but have received the spirit whereby
the spirit itself beareth witness with our that
are the children
let love one for love and every one
that loveth born and knoweth john
whosoever believeth that jesus the christ born and
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that
begotten john
for are all the children god faith christ
are told this life that they might know
thee the only true and jesus whom thou hast
life eternal know the only true yet the
doctrines the lds that have mentioned portray vastly
different jesus that cannot reconciled with the jesus
the they are far removed from each other that proclaim
one being true denies the other from being according the
eternal life dependent knowing the only true and
not the construct
with all due who died and left you chief arbiter
correct biblical mean snotty about
but the fact that the bible differently interpreted different
groups biblical scholars you think the
for that make reference the the
simply whose the you
this really red address any issue but
seeks the fact that some groups try read
something into the change what the bible for
the fact that the witnesses deny the deity christ
does not alter what the bible teaches for that blessed
and the glorious appearing the great god and our saviour jesus
servant and apostle jesus
them that have obtained like precious faith with through
the righteousness god and our saviour jesus peter
the deity
first look the bible see what not
even what the bible teaches because there are some groups that
have differing views see what the bible
you have look the
mortality was essential his own
promised had work out his own salvation
doing the will the father all had
baptized gain admission the celestial
welcome the wonderful world mormon the
above books are the late bruce former general authority
the lds those books were not published the nor
they constitute they consist his
does that mean that what says not not have
think about the idea personal salvation before come any
conclusions the conclusions come may seem
but prepared accept
find this rather when mentioned that the mormon belief
that jesus needed put forward some quotes from the late
bruce the curious part that one addressed the
issue needing rick comes the closest with his
have own addressing the
most the other replies have instead the issue
bruce mcconkie and whether his views were
think that matters views were that not the
were writings indicative mormon belief this
subject the real the indication from rick that they may

	you consider and white supremists hardly
classify them they follow the teachings love
one love your neighbour love your jesus
christ their lord and the persecution they are violating
all the precepts what christ died they are direct violation
the teachings even jesus who was crucified the jewish leaders
that loved his enemies asking the father for forgiveness their
christian and bear animosity towards jews any one
the enemy not our fellow
mark jesus quoted saying believes and baptized
will but whoever does not believe will
consider most and white supremisists christians
they say they are
they feel necessary justify their actions with the bible
where does say the bible that christians are supposed persecute
love your enemies they may say they are
but their actions speak you believe what everyone tells
came believe god own investigation and
and ultimately own was granted only through
the grace
the bible provides with clear definition what christian
tells what christian but then goes say that
long you your sins will
christian model oneself after jesus christ implied the
very name you say you believe your head but not feel
your what does that say your
white supremisists and
may not your brand but believing
they are
white supremists and are not any brand
you hate your whom you can see then how can you love god whom you cannot
what does this belief believing christ and having your sins
forgiven his name does not give christian free licence
repent sin ask forgiveness that sin and try not
but you lump with racists and accuse
being then are you not chinese racial
background and know what part visible minority this
think that would favourably looked upon these
white supremist you call
anyone can say what they but they practice what they
then their belief you
for your original
what bothers most why people who have religious affiliation
continue persecute why this hatred the majority
people who persecute jews are not christians speak for all
christians and there are bound few who are the
you imply here that predominately atheists and agnostics who
persecute hard pressed think even example jewish
persecution the hands
nazis and racists general are the ones that come immediate
what believe that such people may using the bible mask their racial
intolerance and they can they and hide behind christianity
but tell you that jesus would have nothing with
about the only one that
comes mind would the former soviet where many religious
people suffered some sort persecution mention many
who suffered persecution for believing the government
arguement
rob lanphier
the only point trying make that those who call themselves christian
may not ask that you draw your own conclusions what they
and what they they are not modelled after the example jesus
christ then they are not they have not repented their sins
and accepted jesus christ their personal lord and saviour then they are
not these are the only criteria being
may god with
malcolm lee
	true what you stated saving grace available
not just other everyone can have salvation but
not everyone this option now open people other than just
the jews accept the deity would
hardly expect them accept anything that christ but feel
any animosity towards even though they persecuted jesus and his
disciples and eventually crucified bear them ill
feel pity for jesus had die pay the price for our sins and
the jews were merely fulfilling jesus knew had die even
before began his that demonstrates the great depth his love
for
jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth his love for the
children who died today the davidian
but the events today made even more negative concering
organized
understand and sympathize with your what happened waco was very
sad take out christians the branch

crime the saints had was
religious their stance still

guess the mormons what they because they refused bow
the will and secular this
upon them and finally forced expulsion from

significant remember that these secular positions were held
and that the almost all americans were pretty
was largely the mainstream disgust
such practices polygamy which resulted their irrational
but that exactly the the mormon extermination order
was issued not just was allowed under the constitution
the united which was instituted precisely prevent incidents

denying mormons representation their own user

prejudices and practices providing neat justification

any mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities
even discuss how were suckered into allowing part their

the feds back
you mean that the are some continuous group
with the common and uninterrupted goal the
you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for
testing was them thar and what about the
who you seem searching for enemy
the majority are mormon
many cities and settlements throughout the western
paranoid believe that everything that affects you
must have been done primarily for that
what mean that secular authorities are believe
that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth divert

environmental nightmares imposed upon secular which have
brought the and environmental

the branch davidians never posed any threat
like asking who really caused the deaths the israeli olympic
that the police botched the job but
heavier burden them than the terrorists would terrible
think the same sort reasoning applies this
david koresh chose any peaceful the atf and fbi
have the responsibility more his than the
come issue how much the authorities escalated otherwise
peaceful get over and david koresh
come gassing were they they played
right into the hands individual had prepared
his people for this eventuality for and not firetruck plan

had responsibility protect their own even they were

was trying show the absurdity atheistic materialist
trying embrace some common moral system though were
man knows his heart that there right and have
inherited this
matter how suggest that common moral system created
mankind not contrary reason suggest that common
moral system created mankind for the bible
any use mankind moral must interpreted mankind and
workable moral system created for everyday
the jewish talmud the result centuries biblical scholars analysing
every word the torah understand the morality behind the children
israel were given very strict set judicial and ceremonial
laws follow and yet this was clearly not enough cover every instance
moral dilemma their for the situation
seems that the only code morality that have from the
christian god that which contained the bible can see from
the diverse opinions the christian newsgroups not there may well
absolute morality defined the god for mankind
follow but seems that only have subset simply because the concept was
written down
this leads the problem defining morality for our take the
divine morality then have code practice which may interpreted many
different ways consider the immolation heretics the
fifteenth century and the interpretation the bible which allows man
that another man under the precept administer take
agnostic morality then have code practice that can modified suit
society all the danger that this could take
the basis the morality and this create
and justify code morality which suits the society live and enables

let explore this interesting paragraph point sentence
are talking about not merely
origins are speaking the origins the human
the physical biological diversity
science cannot explain
this false statement unless carefully depends
what origins are talking
for person exclude anything but science from the issue origins
say that there higher truth than
this false begin the notion
distinctly many people believe that there are ways
ascertain truth that are not the repetoire they even
believe that there are ways that are more reliable and many
believe that there are truths that cannot expressed using the language
let these truths are neither
they are simply
more the restricting discussion origins science
does not reject other sources simply restricts the
scope
this false
this intended asserting that the previous sentence was false
then actually however the context identifies another
false least theologically
the enjoy
the evidence rawlins lacks sufficient understanding science
enjoy science any meaningful one might just well say
that one enjoys literature written language that one cannot
however one cannot mark this sentence false follow the
perhaps likes the pretty shapes the

still another false however one can make come out true
with the following contextual
misunderstood mixture percent

	one single historic event that has had the biggest impact the
over the centuries the resurrection
this hardly the majority people the world were
lived their and without ever knowing anything about
the majority the rest the world have decided that
not who emery thinks
were the writers the new testament documents convinced that
really did rise from the
have four gospel
leaving out all which rely quoting the
bible circular there have been occasions
already stated many times for later generations xtians
otherwise alter the bible fit their political
and accept the bible true just because the bible says
then have the same the
and the both which contradict the
enough
have reason believe these disciples immoral and
have historic information that would lead the conclusion that
people were not people who sincerely and
that the resurrection their lord jesus was real
for what gain would they make stand that time meant
and perhaps even
this only the biblical account and there independent proof
any this just
simply being sincere willing die for your faith does not
make your faith there are muslims dying bosnia right
does the fact that they are willing die for islam mean that islam
the correct
bears out the persecution roman cornelius
govenor writing alluded
torture christians
all you have proven that these people were tortured for their that
does not prove that their faith true just means that they
were sincere their
being willing die for what you believe make your belief the
not that and minority religions have always suffered
muslims suffer torture and harassment india and bosnia all religions
are harassed china you proven anything
all the suffering and persecution that meant
quite probable that least one those the supposed conspiracy
come forward and confess that the whole thing was big
not they believe that was
not one seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make
the resurrection but sincerely believed that jesus had actually risen
the especially light the sufferings that came upon those
the followers muhammad firmly believed the miracles that the koran
says muhammad they were attacked and slaughtered for their
they denounce muhammad you are
then that means islam the true
you see how stupid your proofs
	these laws written for the chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest the the israelites were
direct witness disobey god after knowing that god
real would outright denial god and therefore immediately
these laws were written for different time and applied only
chosen but jesus has changed all are living the
age sin longer immediately punishable there
repentance and there salvation through our lord jesus and not just
for few chosen salvation available jew and gentile
jews agree with

owe the group habit check articles before and
after their submission for last article
the way you really should have looked the index your
greek you would have found that the word
acts for not stated and nowhere
the very large discussion kleros done the dictionary
the new the meaning
discusses the forms and the various
meanings and but mentions
nothing about chorion does this not surprise thus
would seem very good thing you dumped archer
was admit that not have handle greek and thus
confused the second last word acts being the plot
land actuality which the last word acts
unfortunately greek dictionary does not discuss
cannot report the nuances the
know someone else would have caught though sure that
someone would able but have aversion disseminating
especially when someone else might use that mistake prove
vary noble you want have number sources
show you researching chorion
course the only other reference decenso has given and
bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when accused decenso
actually believing replied that misquoted
you maintain that you find such exegesis
your misquotes are read the beginning this part
response see what really said posting this
you said that there was our
that caused rediscover did not realize
that you would find such garbage unless you were convinced
thank you for correcting your restating
decenso also
these are not necessarily they are will
discuss the land issue later only responding
one you have directed views because
thus apologize for thinking that even decenso could find such
should specify which parts bullinger finds convincing
and quit hiding behind disingenuous mask what bullinger
not necessarily what which you
find the exegisis convincing
one purposes debating these alleged contradictions with you and
others diseminate many different views possible reconciliations
raised various bible scholars and students when present
will clearly distinguish them from now
course without archer and bullinger find that decenso has presented
greek exegisis and decenso has made big thing about not
referring back the actual thus find this demand his part for
quality greek exegisis hypocritical
good but your declaring that these passages are you
have produced only superficial reasonings and nor have you dug
glad you have begun this will begin greek studies
these passages more depth than thought
would appropriate look what decenso has actually used
now know what claims for has stated
often
the text itself
parallel passages
other pertinent scriptures
historical context
historical content
other pertinent historical info
cultural context

grammatical construction
hebrew and greek word studies

see that has also used the other hand has
presented use
historical context

other pertinent historical info
cultural context
cultural content
other pertinent cultural info
grammatical construction even
hebrew and greek word studies archer and bullinger
thus find his vaunted criteria for exegisis just empty
you find such criteria you plan starting
use them the best your will you continue present
shallow observations mean this bad
this point our have not found necessary present
total exegetical analysis these since seem keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core the not believe
necessary use many the above criteria refute your arguments
judas acts and but will best from this point use
several the above since you desire hope you will
will greatly enhance our study these
only thing has actually beyond the passage any other
thus decenso should honest and note that most his list
red herring and his only real criteria seems
the text itself
parallel passages
the reason are mistating the you claim that the
passages contradict one not see the passages contradicting one
they may very well many scholarly sources
matthew may not presenting you but look
your defense this
the the acts passage may not the pieces
silver you have valiant attempt later
stating why you believe
this beginning stages our are laying some scriptural
which will expanded upon through deeper
course the only reason can see drastically reinterpret passage
has done with make agree with another passage
that both could considered
one the reasons have given different exegetical view the passages
that you seem think the majority scholarship wrong concluding these
passages are see problem tony
explanation
how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging
himself matthew and headlong burst
this question the manner which judas died one with which are
constantly confronted our many people point the apparent
discrepancy the two accounts irreconcilable
some have gone far say that the idea inerrant bible
destroyed these contradictory this not the case
matthew relates that judas hanged while peter tells fell and
was crushed the the two statements are indeed but
they necessarily contradict each
matthew does not say that judas did not neither does peter say that
judas did not hang this not matter one person calling
something black and the other person calling both accounts can
true and
possible reconstruction would judas hanged himself tree the
edge precipice that overlooked the valley after hung there
for some the limb the tree snapped the rope gave way and judas
fell down the mangling his body the
the fall could have been before after death either would fit this
this possibility entirely natural when the terrain the
valley hinnom from the bottom the you can see
rocky terraces feet height and almost
there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the
easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks
this way tearing his body important remember that are
not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree how advanced
was the decomposition his body before his
louis gaussen relates story man who was determined kill
this individual placed himself the sill high window and pointed
pistol his then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window
the same
the other person could say that this man took his life shooting
while another could rightly contend committed suicide jumping
form the tall this both are both are true the
case and accounts the death merely
situation different perspectives the same
your only reason for rejecting this your attempt discredit
you related how this impossible highly
what you said earlier
tony
there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the
easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks
this way tearing his body important remember that
are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree how advanced
was the decomposition his body before his
added text this version heavy assuming you are truly
opposed such you should find not but you seem
find tony eisegesis while clearly rejecting david
you discredit explanation based what you deem too for
the but you addressed why you feel that you can say
vain attempt reconcile the but that tell
nor have you shown why you reject that
matthew lying luke are they both
are either both them why you think there such
alleged not think you have ever told what you believe
this
present decenso only asks two questions
you claim acts and matthew contradict one another representing
ask you again provide evidence that matthew stated judas
died the
you claim that the pieces silver matthew that judas threw down
the temple and the chief priests the
acts that pictures judas some way purchasing field
therefore there prove that the pieces silver
and the are one and the
actually find question rather stupid but will answer
because now restricts himself two first would point out
that hanging very efficient manner for ending fact
bit fluke when someone survives hanging fantasy cowboy
and even then usually referred attempted
work agency that investigates child abuse and got
call child that attempted suicide hanging himself because his mother
failed his attempt and psych ward
local hanging attempts are not always
assume that because most hangings are this one was also
the may quote
listening bible answer the christian
research one the scholars there used several these
terms that you not all that familiar with the man the bam
show teaches comparative religion and was
prevalent that say man hung himself with other
qualifiers synonymous with stating that killed
qualifiers are important see passage mention
does hanging always have this did who the only source
have judas hanging state that judas died say
synonymous means has the same meaning boy hung but
this only one probably thousands documented cases can
not alone this since decenso respects
christian scholarly greek did some
thank
not one the christian references interpreted the
hanging being anything but fatal
use christian sources back your what about
you value even consider valid
possible that the sources you read may
deceived other parts their should have done
with toss them the side and not value anything they including
their the hanging sure would find
some errors and maybe even some deception those
you also noted they the hanging meaning although
that very possibly you find that the text
the first criteria must
biblical knowledge woodward and
which good source commentary but not
interpreters volume commentary the laydon
one volume bible dunelow
meanings the ralph earl
abingdon bible published abingdon
bible william neal
could have presented many more
appreciate your doing this maybe are getting somewhere
how both should approach these alleged contradictions more depth
each these references specifically describe that the interpretation
matt suicide and thus can only conclude that the
greek word hang translated successful
you only conclude tony this was highly
probable but matthew does not state death being
the greek word matthew only occurrence the new
the septuagint greek translation the used the time
only used samuel when ahithophel saw that his advice was
not saddled and arose and went home his his
then put his household and hanged and and
was buried his
notice that not only stated that ahithophel
but explicitly here have doubt the
are not explicitly told judas
there nothing the greek suggest success simply
means
you are more than welcome disagree and show more reputable
christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not
you mean ones that have never
far insisting that the hanging was that
even
said earlier
although still agree with exegesis being the most probable
explanation regarding death into account several
recently noticed some new things
mat then threw down the pieces silver the temple and
and went and hanged but the chief priests took the silver pieces and
not lawful put them into the because they are the
price and they consulted together and bought with them the
bury strangers therefore that field has been called the field
blood this
first notice that the text does not say that judas died result
all says that and hanged luke
tells that falling burst open the middle and all
his entrails gushed this pretty clear indication with the
other details given acts the need pick new
that least after was the whole concept that
matthew and luke both recount death highly but not clear
also
here have that have say just recently
look the passage
mat have sinned betraying innocent and they
that you see
mat then threw down the pieces silver the temple and
and went and hanged
mat but the chief priests took the silver pieces and not
lawful put them into the because they are the price
mat and they consulted together and bought with them the
bury strangers
mat therefore that field has been called the field blood this
notice verse and hanged
matthew does not say judas does should assume died
result the
what does acts
act this man purchased field with the wages and
falling burst open the middle and all his entrails gushed
act written the book his dwelling place
and let one live another take his
here may have graphic explanation line
reasoning dispel your contradiction myth accounts
death necessarily explain how judas does
say judas but specifically say judas died the
hanging
acts seems show his graphic there
contradiction between matthew and acts
know from matthew that did hang himself and acts probably records
his although possible and plausible that fell from the hanging
and hit some thereby bursting can longer assume that
the matthew did not say judas died
result the did most scholars believe probably
quoted all that show that highly regard the but
looking the texts assume judas
highly
the while all agree that judas died from the the books had
different ways dealing with the contradiction are one
simply ignored entirely and simply referred back version
the correct version both matt and biblical knowledge
suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when his belly
exploded explain his headlong that his branch rope
and fell his death and his gut gushed out explain
how hanging would fall headlong rather than feet
the outcome any fall dependent upon many high the person
was suspended before the any obstructions such tree branches that may
have deviated the how steep incline rocky surfaces the victim fell
thus possibly rolling bouncing several
superficial examination the acts passage and the matthew are not
given lot info the geographical but tony the above quoted
post gave
possible reconstruction would judas hanged himself tree the
edge precipice that overlooked the valley after hung there
for some the limb the tree snapped the rope gave way and judas
fell down the mangling his body the
the fall could have been before after death either would fit this
this possibility entirely natural when the terrain the
valley hinnom from the bottom the you can see
rocky terraces feet height and almost
there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the
easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks
this way tearing his body
now not see what comforting about matthew confusing the
source the field but the other hand the author
matthew does make that course biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word the bible guaranteed true will have
thereby add one more contradiction the death judas where the
prophesy the field came
when are done with this study his remind discuss
this with
your second question you ask how could sure that the
money with which judas purchased the was indeed for the rather
than some other would point out that where specifically
mention reward also specifically mentions
what act iniquity they were talking about acts
judas who was guide those who arrested now would point out
that when the bible describes act and then immediately
discusses reward would rather inane suggest that
was action iniquity other than the one
are getting
act and those days peter stood the midst the disciples
the number names was about hundred and and
act and this scripture had which the holy
spirit spoke before the mouth david concerning who became guide
those who arrested
act was numbered with and obtained part this
act this man purchased field with the wages and
falling burst open the middle and all his entrails gushed
act and became known all those dwelling that field
called their own akel that field
act written the book his dwelling place
and let one live another take his
notice that verse the word not states
that judas guide those who arrested
but the writer did not stop was numbered with and
obtained part this what part did judas play their
joh this not that cared for the but because was
and had the money and used take what was put
joh for some because judas had the money that jesus had
said those things need for the that should give
something the
now know what part judas played was per
right after peter stated that judas played part this ministry
according then luke adds the parenthetical explanation
money that should have been put into the but was stolen
judas purchase believe this better exegetical
explanation what the what you
since have given you clear answers even perhaps you
could unequivocally state what type inerrantist you are asking
what type think you you did
will gladly admit that complete although not have
that big problem with the limited inerrancy

order oriental ordo templi
the hermetic brotherhood
modern school like the ancient schools
derived its knowledge from the this knowledge
was never its was recorded parable
and requiring key for its
key can placed within the reach all those apply
for membership the oriental templars
body initiates whose hands are

	are you happy now when including innocent
amazing how everyone automatically blames one side the
one thing for koresh will have chance defend himself
against the statements fact court sponsored
made agents who participated the situation that killed
know they murdered also know
that the branch davidians set fire and
sick batf fbi spokepeople make such
comments advance forensic
thank god
kinda thought something like this was going happen
week one the things been obvious from the
that when there are two armed neither which
usually get slaughtered when any little spark
why koresh and company have stockpiled
why the batf have come primed for
the only one
peaceful attempt serve
months develop scene and six days end
children
least adults
plus the beginning
and more batf agents
all
point
the davidians fired first why were the batf
the roof rather than taking
has anyone asked themselves these
have you seen the entire video sequences taken during the
opening seem recall missing several key
the first five minutes day only the shooting
part comes
what happened the feds video you mean they
not carry helmet wonder why
how you can have camera crews with live transmission
video present and not have uninterrupted
you realize the units carry ittle bitty
that hold minutes per and there are
twounits the professional handhelds
tape turnover
until all views are premature point
fingers either
you well point
could have touched
mistake
more this
koresh was his being religious
and apocalyptically most likely the people
just went just like the batf
the lesson that automatic responses are very hazardous last resort
but hard toremain human under the full
pressure game and
point
side could have backed help defuse the
see the problem constantly here the
with
nuff
more the when someone dies like was intended
that both sides will kill maintain their innocence
contradiction
point
help take sides such just
fuel the better let burn out
usually pick the unpopular side and point out
from the evidence seen what might have alternatively
example can think christ with the tax
one sanction the roman authority when
showed noted that was and
said give waste and then got back
worthwhile concerns
this requires someone interested please note
that the outstanding problem this country today
one where the
wants coin pay off the
movement and the
well note who the issuing authority ditto for those
the american not the federal
and not spent towards that deserves
the
the image
fewpeople hear the
money
made
the image
god
need stir things ever larger
turn and and
wish you were many pundits are saying
the onyl good thing come out divorce
exposure the damned american divorce attorney
have money left lose taxes
point
this was just
another thriller like
ball
the lesson that become jaded media
children anyone thinks blaming koresh the batf
helps this any and
the reason you can tell that the batf may not entirely
straight this that the leaders press conferences
havew made any comments about even the possibility that
koresh his followers caused
the batf agentss are more concerned with their repuations
and morals koresh did than they
are
dead
same goes for koresh his followers who are all
point
the davidians one case society has
the people which has returned
the other the outskirts were bumping against the
the lesson that lawful different areas
more conditions than
more power and personal
look whenever privilege has replaced whatever
token objective law and justice society has
hitlerrs have
least make honest
next conflagration will doubt closer
than putting out there much more important
for work
you your name sake
its but please keep keeping
each voice the wilderness now will
save generation unborn from horror
today
keeps from being loving god
that for one direct benefit being able
things
the day gun abomb protect myself this
society the day that society already beyond redemption
and that you have any christian
belief
and the day that cannot peacefully enjoin others the
act that thoreau called civil disobedience rectify the
wrongs that society without undue harm
punishment befalling the day that society has ceased
human and become society
are cclose
who hurts more the ones who the loved ones who
besides the also time for many
those lost their faith
learning and let things god
six years fighting unjust court still struggling
for those who like contrary
was not not branch davidian nor law
official hate liars the six letter variety
the official side has its advocates lets balance the
equation and asj few questions the other for the sake
old saw the batf abd fbi seem want
innocent until proven
not
innocent until presumed
where are the video tapes from the all
tell they not they are standard
you think koresh fired the because the
tear gas comes with aerosol spread this
aerosol deliberately made
when isolation from other
why was pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
why did the fbi not announce
blown plus tear five then the wall come
and maintain left right
most aerosols also have secondary that when
mixed becomes very flammable difficult
with very special exposure
brief eruptions high heat long
exposure low heat will not tend
what other chemicals come the
who else will allowed test the
after few minutes hours the combnation
rate can controlled the mixture can made
become veryignitable onb exposure temperature
above certain point tracer for certain
heat quantity small explosive for length
time wall fire and
check your military look the
why were tanks capacity delivey
tear gas not and now
the was there still comm channel open
the
you see any trace fire coming back the
compound the all the which ones
are
sound probably
you trust the fbi and batf render
advance god help
are surely not helping
you trut the federal gevernment give clean
you are trillion down and
look
did happen that not was not
and should wait for court
but will that people will not have the chance
tell their side the batf leader
one more force next
listen your

	objective morality morality built from objective
where those objective values come how can measure
mediated thair interaction with the real scalar
real has its basis not the other way
you would wish there such thing objective then
can not objectively said more useful than kick the
theories with accurate predictions could not objectively said
more useful than set tarot you like those
think that you are changing the meaning perhaps
time backtrack and take look the
value fair equivalent return for such goods
monetary material worth measured
usefulness quality
considered inherently worthwhile precise
assigned calculated numerical
the relative duratation tone the relative darkness
lightness the distinctive quality speech speech
context moral definition four seems fit terms
scientific definitions six eight might note that
these definitions not mean the same
say that science has its basis values bit
science has its basis observable even the usages the
word above not denote observable but rather standard
would conclude that science does not have its
basis and your statement above one
concludes that scientific set measurements are based
systems derived from then must follow that
scientific there such thing there such thing
back the this has nothing with moral system
just because the word used both contexts does not mean
that there relationship between the two
one argue for objective values moral then one must
first start demonstrating that morality itself considering
the meaning the word doubt that this will ever
back the original
and objective morality
you can provide objective foundation for then that will

eric
	from materialistic point could said that the nervous
just what wrong with producing chemical reactions
this matter and and
all morality were big hairy
you appear the only person saying that all morality
most people know hold some absolutes their
moral
believe that the dignity the individual and the right
free will are recognize that there are some moral
systems around which accept reject them dangerous
and some forms fundamentalist
not but for the most almost
every moral system agrees these two
the and everything everything that was created came out
including this part
wrong put parts god test tube and make through
that form
christians believe other
believe one big accept yor
too know get enforce view upon you whether
you like premise and since you prove there
even intellectual basis for your resistance accepting
long will before the long hurt someone
more and more relative until the only rule that left
will what want matter who
big jump between those two and you know very
play realize that trying dispute
you call using what you think
stretching this bit too
think once morality becomes
that reasoning that generally evil hurt other people
think
then answer you seem opposed moral relativism
you call because has the capacity
you would advocate nonrelative moral
whose absolutist moral system
how come this
what about people who disagree with the chosen moral
morality considered
and this rule based but just arbitrary
people might abandon
can agree with most what you typed just because
morality gets based something nonrelative does not mean that have
pick your xtianity its
can start morality based dignity freedom
and never ever rely xtianity for just because
someone has consistent moral system based true principles does not
mean that they have involve xtianity xtianity certainly does not
have monopoly principles fewer religions are
guiltier violating their own principles
	have this highly christian religious order that put fire
their killing most the people
have way know that the cultists burned the could have been
batf and only have the word for after and
who started search with concussion grenades are hardly

are you subtly accusing evil things because never
the this even more confusing because
even admit that like the situation where not

agenda behind stop trying look for
easy and straight forward
not accusing you evil jesus accusing
and not only you that accusing
you and everyone the world whether one
sees the light does not seen the light has nothing with
whether evil them
jesus uses the word jesus not soloing you
jesus making general statement about out the sad state
christians are not immuned from doing evil christian
just person whom the holy spirit christian
can see the evil his evil has been brought
out into the jesus not saying that just because evil has been
that the christian will stop doing you
seen your evil deeds simply been
exposed the his you may shed some light your
your human spirit shines perhaps but the
holy spirit shines the holy spirit can
shine light into places inside where even know
you see christians are not nonchristians
are not nonchristians not want come into the
light jesus because they will see all the problems their
and they will not like the ugly thing see how far
have fallen from you think you want
know how really ignorant you you think brian kendig wants
you think want ego verses the
which you
watching the news about man who saw the and made
that the children burned death part his insight
the think the world that and
act such ways when you are then happy
and pray will never receive such
and watched koresh imposter who thought saw the
who made sure that the children burned part
his even sadder that the people who
died with him chose die with and that ignorance was
their downfall
and you bury yourself underneath rock with
excuse like bringing koresh actually had truth
david koresh was light and excuse for
you stay away from the real jesus david who
claimed was was david koresh
was born jesus was born koresh
even good imposter having missed obvious point
jesus warned such imposters the david
koresh anything new jesus told
aware imposters years
the next time imposter makes scene and claims
ask the where were you was your
name the branch davidians asked that
simple they would have labeled koresh liar
right from the the have followed
they have but look what their
ignorance cost them their their choice ignorant
cost them
since you studied the bible under you
not remember what tactic satan used try tempt
did not satan quote the bible out you
remember what tactic the serpent genesis used tempt
did not misquote what satan used eve and
was the same ploy tried but
jesus rebuked satan back with the bible
work with
does what satan did eve the garden and what satan
tried with jesus the desert remind you what
koresh did his who did koresh
who was koresh did his followers what
satan did did not koresh kill his did
not satan cause adam and eve die did not
the cult followers believe koresh even though they knew
the real christ was born did not eve
choose eat from the tree the knowledge good and
evil despite knowing that would cause her god
held them all and the none
them had
opposed the branch have second
follow jesus and will escort the path eternal
follow and you stand condemned for like
the branch davidian your house already
adam and eve have already set just
slow but burning

just want brian honest with really wants
will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing with wish brian would read the
bible for himself and come his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation mock
from perspective when look brian see man
standing out the middle off into the distance
see mack truck heading right for but brian faced away

you consider the word testify the
surrounding
there are two problems
brian kendig
peter died two millenia the original letters wrote have
since decayed into were alive today and could
you question the existence alexander the tilgrath pilisar
cyrus the their documents
have decayed dust why another
even peter did witness the miracles jesus two millenia
mean that your deity what the bible says
just trying convince everyone that nice
even that your deity still alive and active the world
peter wrote bit the what peter says about god what
the bible
consider the bible court over the period thousands
various people come and testify their experience with the
living comes abraham the wealthy comes
once the high official comes comes
mere shepherd who became comes the pagan king
comes the pagan king comes
cupbearer the king then irs agent
takes the comes then paul jew who use
kill christians for comes year old
comes comes the brother jesus
comes hundreds you hear testimony from irs
the court hearing lasts thousands years
with people coming and testifying about the god who calls himself
while you are listening all this you realize that
king david could have never known solomon could have never known
nehemiah could have never known you realize that all these
people are independent and you rule out yet
all the witnesses tell the same each testifier tells
his own experiences with the living each experience
but each experience has enough unmistakenly
reveal that each one these people talking about the very same
what daniel did not know about the highest official
god revealed john years with different
two testimonies are each testimony
dares venture off what already yet each
even though different from those consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets the character the same
stare gazing the you got this seeming fanatic
the other end the know this god has
revealed himself also calls himself jesus
please believe telling the wonderful know
are you going just pass off all this testimony
are you going call three thousand years worth testimony from
shepherds irs agents royal officials kings computer
with scoff your with near
complete ignorance the are you going say that
that all complete would that not the most audacious
display you actually think you know better than
king king even abraham
	what thou wilt shall the whole the
the word sin kid
does one words encompass the majestic vision thousands
quoting man not the same quoting the
taken out words can interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines
their original
think this the case regarding hymenaeus frater superior
the order which when included that bit
from merlinus did all showed the extremes
which order members have been known their
have little knowledge regarding but surely
was unusual and was important force the order
for many
yet people change orders and while look back
carefully the dirty laundry remember that this
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one hope show that there
was and much room for difference opinion within the order
perhaps testing the limits
let examine this issue bit more
karl kellner wealthy austrian industrialist
and paper well founded the ordo
templi kellner had traveled widely the where
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical
efforts develop the order were later assisted franz
heinrich klein and theodore who had worked together
prior joining the the order was first proclaimed
masonic
reuss succeeded him outer head the edition
the published announced that the order taught
secret sexual
reuss was interesting born june
entered masonry was journalist and
possibly spy for the prussian political infiltrating the socialist
league founded karl daughter and her reuss was
later associated with william wynn leader the golden
who later introduced him john yarker chartered reuss
found the rites memphis and mizraim after several
attempts concretize various masonic reuss settled the
development the
order experienced reasonably steady growth under
for chartered papus rudolph steiner berlin
and spencer lewis the the historic meeting between
reuss and crowley crowley wrote that reuss came him and
accused him revealing order when crowley looked
the initiated interpretation sexual magick unfolded itself him for
the first reuss appointed crowley supreme and holy king all
the english speaking and was this authorization that invoked
when publishing the material the
resigned outer head the order after suffering
stroke and named crowley his all was well until when
book the was translated into there was break
the continuity the manyk members split with the new
over the which crowley was actively promulgating through the
had earlier revise dthe order rituals deeply
infusing the doctrines the new aeon
introduction the history the veritatem
within edited
hymenaeus frater rex summus
caliph the united states
published samuel
there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this
material and this the real
why did wish publish such things about the history his own
does represent dogmatic threat the principle
exercising his true will and putting forth very
complex pictures with easy picture which leaves room
for very many
quite easy for for that all derived
out the dribble faltering purchased clever hucksters
with ounce courage and some writing ability aid and
can take that all the way down our present whose feeble
support the laughable
would thrown out the order for speaking this
will
think
because frater will see interjection
using illustration shows that may express things
the context larger work and the true significance this may
quite difficult apprehend
may with oto and merlinus please look more
not support words not qualified assess
and critical their who member
the order take such stand and allowed continue doing then
what can this say about the health the does mean that
the order has and abandoned its moral
does mean that strong its ability let the will
universal kinship arise its not shackled some dogmatic
how shall resolve these two
find high calibre individual associated with ordo templi
they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed arcane
usual they are quite often artists and
having met some longstanding members the bay area who are
were very heavily involved with the can vouch for the integrity
the organization
have sometimes questioned the policy hymenaeus these moments
followed and found little stop from requesting
second initiation from different happily participating
social groups and have come know the gnostic
mass well enough for
this make authority order politics and
can only hypothesize and relay you what understand based
limited contact with other
urge you not take the words merlinus too there are many
ways interpret and many people who have become involved with
the order feel very strongly about the sanctity personal freedom
and the preservation individual

	the divine masters
most christians would and correctly that
jesus christ was divine and projection god
into the physical god
but there are some very important related facts that
christians are completely ignorant are followers
most other world
jesus christ was not john
there always least one such divine master
physically alive this world all
continuous succession throughout both before and
after the life
the followers some these masters founded the
major usually perverting the teachings
their master the for added
threats and deleted the
teaching
and more after particular
master physically dies and leaves this there
nothing that can for anybody except for the relatively
few people that initiated while was still physically
simply the way god set things the
all those christians who worship and
pray and expect jesus return and save them from
their are only kidding and have allowed
themselves duped religion that was mostly
manufactured the
and emotional are totally deceiving
indicator for religious
these things are similarly true for followers most
other major world including
the primary function each master tune
his initiates into the life
john and
river revelation and personally
guide each them thru the upper levels heaven while they
are still connected their living physical bodies
true which completes cycles

only reaching least the which five
levels universes above the physical and this
cannot done without the help divine
one such divine master alive today sri

many christians are likely confuse the masters with
the which was temporary world
dictator during the but the masters
ever even when asked expected

people who continue following
other orthodox religions with will
continue their cycles between the
psychic planes and this miserable physical until they
finally accept initiation from divine
the book and ruth
describes several kinds evidence supporting reincarnation
fact including hypnotic regressions past
lives the subconscious mind sometimes
makes things especially with bad
spontaneous recall young some
whom can identify their most recent previous
dream recall past life

always use the james later

typically originate from past for
strong fear swimming traveling over water usually
results from having drowned the end previous
and sometimes person will take immediate dislike

behave much better toward each other they knew that their
actions the present will surely reaped them the

divine master physically dies

	here someone just told that the old testament books were translated
into greek long time ago
famous version called the was translation
greek
and that the originals were destroyed fire soon
know what referring when the jersusalem temple was
some manuscripts may have been but think our extant hebrew
are good our greek know about any
the person who was telling about the septuagint version said that the greeks
had wonderful library alexandria that was full
and that was burned soon after the septuagint version was translated
conceal some changes the different perhaps just
part the typical burning valuable things that occurs during changes
power
was just since imagine some jewish people somewhere must
have had copies the earlier hebrew the hebrew version the
old testament very different from the greek derived
there are few famous discrepancies prophecy about
was changed into which was how the new testament writers
but not
perhaps this the answer
you jewish get bible translated
will some differences but the text
basically the
you want read you can buy interlinear that
the hebrew old testament and the greek new with english
written underneath each
you want bible with basic you can try
find samaritan never seen the samaritans
not the good have their own version the books
claim the jewish bible was altered
thanks for the now just have find someone teach samaritan

	read your was nothing had seen much the same other
sentimental gay people are and will
tinue persecuted long such propaganda you may
unaware all the statistica concerning that
have been published and used various groups their own bias
against usually think the kkk these
but there are many other the vast majority the public
scoff such findings and documents but that was not always the
fortunately had who supported their and
public sentiment was eventually not turned there was
even civil and sentiment until laws
were put place protect the inalienable rights blacks was pretty
much legal discriminate against
know many gays and will not turn back them their right free
form you may think that have been deceived
that your christian church
openly affirms the rights oppressed people all segments
including believe the gospel message preaching all creation
and making believe the great commandment
and beleive standing for the even not popular
really like church for last reason the can find
church almost anywhere the valley that stands for the gospel and believes
the commandment love find many who actually
sho but not many are willing champion the especially
within their own may have lost face with the greater christian
community for the unpopularity but did the abolitionists
against the oppression many were even killed and
treated runaway slaves for being and guess
decided the challenge worth
talks with gay men and women have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt the funny thing know one
case where the even children have continued reject
their gay family member after they
began take part some form support like
apalled the legislation which passed and equally
raged that such slimey people louis sheldon the tradition values
have been actively working the christian underground garner
support within several states this coming november for more
oppressive legisation against
perhaps you get and maybe you never many get the
middle ages and the proclaimed will done they massacred thousands
witch hunts and
the message that comes loud and proponents against gay
rights and against gays that there strong even
hatred for whether you want call such not change
the the major flaw all this posturing that the the
final effect posts like that yours and hudson that you have
love for change and love this
sure strange coming from group who claim that god has
one that calls people they sure there are things that
will and habits wife that
need changed through some sort but then there are things
like that amount beating out
going result anything more than outward conforminty
the process this coerced conformity causes many
people great deal especially when caused people who have
nothing more gain from that become even more puffed about their
own sense
this but thoroughly believe that one day will may
unpopular cry for justice and equality when the basis has with
something very personal like taboo subject even but
firmly believe the rights individuals free from impose regulation
thier funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive
but like maintain this little chestnut though
helps maintain sense superiority over least one segment
gay people are not
another interesting thing happened very prominent charismatic
church the silicon valley had two pastors arrested for
admitted charges pederasty having sex with this had apparently
been going for some time couple but since the charges were
and the church worked closely with the imagine that
was how they managed downplay the how could such thing
happen when the has one friends
recently told was someone who going through the
reparitive therapy and was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not invitation attend the
these are difficult times live but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating atmosphere that breed hate and violence not
the call the christian the results the passing amendment
colorado has created organization posters are appearing all over
colorado called forget the whole definition off
but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual and their motto
for with implicit advocation for
this and seems what you and and others are
christians have loooooooooong tradition coersion and oppression
towards those feel and constant beratement from
organizations like the christian research while they have good
purpose their major work seems finding new and better ways
excluding
the gospel believe not rather seeks ways
have several books and find them quite
especially concerning but seems that has become cult unto
why just stick the positive and find ways bring people

	true what you stated saving grace available
not just other everyone can have salvation but
not everyone this option now open people other than just
the jews accept the deity would
hardly expect them accept anything that christ but feel
any animosity towards even though they persecuted jesus and his
disciples and eventually crucified bear them ill
feel pity for jesus had die pay the price for our sins and
the jews were merely fulfilling jesus knew had die even
before began his that demonstrates the great depth his love
for
jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth his love for the

	the prophesy clearly implies that people would
living the but the same token would
obviously people are still there they
live their implies fishing
this exactly what has become far cry from
original position stature
looking find that during roman times vied with sidon
for first place the intellectual life the that tyre was
the seat christian eventually with dioceses under
that most magnificent church its kind all was the
basilica built tyre that tyre was well known for its
exports white and dyed that
along with other outlets for south indian
and even chinese that tyre had accomodate its growing
population rather than line
was running out land build that tyre
established colonies its none this sounds like
fishing any stretch the
centuries under the tyre had and flourishing
and buildings during this tyre was
for its export
during the tyre was the flourishing city held
lot but got tired
read the following description modern
lebanon include baalbek and
this source also discusses the impact
the lebanese civil and the israeli military actions
the trading ports tyre and notes that after
withdrawel appeared enjoy revival its local
tyre such insignificant little fishing village
why always called city why
does show all the when population figures for cities
lebanon are why tyre always one the cities the
list the list only dozen cities
philip from the earliest times
the
federal research library
country edited thomas
the early tyre had over
far seen stated figurers ranging from
assume the latter one modern standards
are talking about
sounds like lot work for one
tyre connected roads the they
may even use cars these
the encyclopedia britannica says
most other references give figures the thousand
atlas gives the population tyre the same
source give comparatively high figures for sidon and
doubt that perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding doubt that the
population tyre has fluctuated over the last few
the israeli military action hurt tyre quite
after alex the fell once more the what
times did fall that you were thinking
egypt the seleucids rome after
fell various arab contingents until when was
the was then recaptured again the muslims
and subsequently then the
thought you were talking about times that tyre was
not these apply not just tyre but
the other cities the for can you make
case for tyre having been singled
recovered enough have thriving commerce the dye
roman
but they were under roman and the
the created wealth was siphoned the prophesy
they had good deal autonomy under the from
tyre the rights from antiochus ephiphanes
and from onward complete she started
large series occasionally gold
the descriptions tyre under the romans seem fit
your and under the abbasids seems
have been allowed still think you are stretching
when you try describe tyre having been nothing but small
fishing
josh
christian apologist whose standards scholarship are quite
happens quote the same source you quote
through the dar
the same defends the fulfillment the
prophecy using the same argument you are argument that
seen print anywhere which why jumped
the conclusion that you were quoting
tried find the jidejian but listed books
can you tell more about her descriptions are
much odds with everything else curious know
	and deuteronomy
these laws written for the chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest the the israelites were
direct witness disobey god after knowing that god
real would outright denial god and therefore immediately
these laws were written for different time and applied only
chosen but jesus has changed all are living the
age sin longer immediately punishable there
repentance and there salvation through our lord jesus and not just
for few chosen salvation available jew and gentile
for book that only applied the israelites jesus sure
quoted lot alludes several
other places just case
clear jesus thought the old testament repeat the
verse matthew which gets quoted this group
not think that have come abolish the law the have
not come abolish them but fulfill tell you the until
heaven and earth not the smallest not the least stroke
will any means disappear from the law until everything
anyone who breaks one the least these commandments
and teaches others the same will called least the kingdom
but whoever practices and teaches these commands will called
great the kingdom for tell you that unless your
righteousness surpasses that the pharisees and the teachers the
you will certainly not enter the kingdom
pretty red that you know jesus
this causes serious dilemma for christians who think the old testament
apply think why paul harvey likes quoting
much
rob lanphier
will clarify earlier laws were originally written for
the jesus changed that fact now making the law applicable
all not just the gentiles could part the kingdom
heaven through the saving grace never said that the law was made
obsolete
clarified the law such that quote you the
following jesus takes several portions the law and expounds upon
the law giving clearer meaning what god
also reams into the pharisees for mucking the law with their own contrived
they knew every letter the law and followed with their
heads but not their that why points out that our righteousness
must surpass that the pharisees order accepted into the kingdom
people such the pharisees are those who really out their
way debate about the number angels that can dance the head
they had become religious lawyers who practiced the
letter the law but never really believed
think you will agree with that there are lot
pharisees who know the bible from end end but not believe
what good head knowledge there nothing the
christianity not just set lifestyle that changes
perspectives and personal and demands obedience
some people can live but many others cannot will that their
choice and have respect because god respects

perhaps you should read and stop advancing the bible evidence relating
questions
jesus
there great fallacy your the question origins
based more than science
science best determining religions handle
why and
the problem that most scientists exclude the possibility the
supernatural the question this fair
not its not its that scientists
the most exlude the possibility not its
scientists are not
utterly reject the hypothesis that science the highest form
and long before you clearly you have deep and
fundamental misunderstanding
you met man who could walk
raise people from the claimed the son and
then referred the inviolability the this would affect
your belief the origin can expand
affect knowledge origins anatomically
modern that man could show something even
was the biblical story exact but then would the
world did your father endow with intellect and and then proceed
fool the bible says nothing about the creatures that
know
some these creatures were some were
some were fancifully reconstructed from
absolutely and utterly false for some were lucy
and about taking into
consideration bilateral lucy walked upright and just
like and the two share remarkably similar dental her
cranial morphology unlike humans modern there are hundreds
other specimens this and other which only some are
they exist you can touch feel hold
but forget the the the cultural record all look and
test out ancient they are not has god has tricked
here
doubt any will meet man like your version all
this absolutely still worried about
probaby make and like help other
all did was use the reason and intellect your god
she benevolent and loving will understand you
good deeds not justify person
atonement needed atone for
and other fundamentalists what about the billions who
say beware people who say they have the and reconsider
each time you think you
science and
the bible are not god can supercede the scientific
man understands creation good god has the
power create something out order out
been but have that the veterans will
agree with you and god anything
the more
god the like
that was not your your point above was god the power
scientists generally agree with far cry from saying god

people subordinate positions are especially obligated refrain from

people should seek education and employment outside the unless
named
people should use common they should not kill other people
just because they are told
interpretation events based current
they were supposed eat the god gave wanted them seek knowledge
rather than handed silver once they had gained knowledge
and seeking showed their ability make mature decisions for
they longer needed treated like little children and were
rewarded being allowed into the
lessons from new
ignorance knowledge but must
having food provided for you for nothing best
temporary getting job and feeding yourself with what you earn

authority figures are often normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really good idea and
bad they should think for
people subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek and all the for poor children
without good schools should work especially hard order make better
life for their children
have tentatively named this new philosophy church because
decision eat the apple first good instead

directed similar accusation again based lack
response article robert toward

understand why jim thinks needless
have time reply article that takes quote
out
asked jim the
according the only way criticize one person for
quote out without being post
person who takes quote out
jim replied saying
either ask assert
but today find four articles from one which has the subject
not the case the eyes the when someone aware
and has the capability taking action and does that individual
held responsible for that
which complete red taking quotes out
context have time read every article
and certainly under obligation reply them
does imply that jim thinks that because
respond articles must condone taking quotes
out jim want give direct answer this
read what has written and decide for
but back the context conversation with next
gambit was claim that was using inductive logic when
concluded that was being challenged him provide
the details that logic that led him incorrect
today find another obscure article twice help

only black geese are observed not valid question
concerned with the different behavior between black and white
more red could jim mean that has read uncountably large
number could jim mean that because his
but not wants conclude inductively
see where going with
but can help him with his written roughly
articles since the vast majority them are discussions with
frank decenso and other where take the position that
they are making bad some are discussions with jim meritt
where take the position that making bad arguments straw man

beings the sun and welcomed him and
acclaimed his each its own and
each bearing one his
now would require voluminous work mention all
his the punctilious scholars have written
many volumes concerning the proofs his
here will briefly point out only the general category
into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted
accurate
the evidences the prophethood muhammad
fall into two main
the first called irhasat and includes the paranormal
events that happened the time his before his
declaration
the second group pertains all the remaining evidences
the and contains two
those wonders that were manifested after
his departure from this world order confirm his
and
those that exhibited during the era
his the latter has also two
the evidences his prophethood that became manifest
his own his inner and outer his moral
conduct and and
the miracles related substantial
the last part again has two
those concerning the and and
those relating matter and this last
branch again divided into two
the first involves the paranormal happenings
that occured during his mission either break the
stubbornness the augment the
faith the this category has twenty different
such the splitting the the flowing
water from the the satisfying large numbers with
little and the speaking rocks and animals
each these sons has also many and thus
the strength confirmation
for the second this
includes events lying the future that occured had
predicted upon allah now starting

the blood that makes atonement for the

makes sense that leviticus would support physical injury
moral
know about been taught all about sunday
catechism and theology but even after all
still accept maybe still not understanding
maybe just understanding all too
from the bottom heart know that the punishment innocent
man tried repeatedly over the course several years
accept but just this means that accept the
premise that god who would allow this then
what ignorance you can show guess wait
you can explain why the death jesus was
then would very glad hear and you might even convert
that heard all the most common arguments
and they just convince

that rousseau
	have this highly christian religious order that put fire
their killing most the people
would hardly consider the they were acting
direct contradiction second coming something
that everyone will know jesus also predicted that there will
false messiahs who will use his his prophecy has been
not that annoyed about the they knew supposedly what
they were and their own
what mostly are angry about the fact that the people
including let the children suffer and die during awful
agree with you
this considered religious following the proud
that follow such fanatical and
have already given life god tells lay
down will save another
you might want die for whatever but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing with this
have hard time just now understanding that christianity
knows about the word you think
the actions today would produce good picture your
you judge all christians the acts those who would call
themselves christian and yet are the contradicted scripture
their they were not simple perhaps
you have read too much into what the media has ask any
christian and you will find that they will deny any
association with the even the day adventists have denied any
further ties with this which was what they
you judge all muslims the acts committed saddam

	should probably leave this but what the
was the name the guy responsible for much the
props used the early nazis their rallies and
name not and hitler does claim that came
the swastika
but credit the actual flag design party member some dentist
believe gives such credit mein
was killed early nazi and many his associates
flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant
have been trying find there any actual evidence for this
assertion postings such groups and
has not uncovered any who could provide
but all the histories nazi germany assert they
make reference several scandals that occurred long before night the
long the impression that got was that homosexuality portions
the was common book homosexual author whose name
escapes the called asserts that roehm
and heines were well others
the books say that roehm and his edmund
have been able find nothing beyond and
this sort historical urban
the one who you believe the history
look the primary sources those outside germany not
have access you seems that there were plenty
documented instances several the fact that the the
long several members were found sleeping
also believe some people were complaining about the
homosexual activities young the histories that
read make very convincing none this sounds like urban legend
unreliable says that the nazi finance
was gives
know next nothing about irving and nothing about what precisely
you that would contradict all the other history books that have
read concerning the existence homosexual are you trying say that
all historians are taking part what about
homosexual writers who agree with the official you think they
would have found out the truth now roehm and heines were not
would think they would want disassociate homosexuality from one
should use any connection between the two bash homosexuals any
challenge anyone document this
you are going challenge historians this point just
then the burden proof track down the find out where
the stories originate you are the one close
archival material most people the net are
found great
evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the
this seems include all the worst
and many
what your agenda prove that the nazis were
that you can bash does bother you that some the nazis
might have been does this make all homosexuals bad this
course and what about are they
know why would difficult believe that some nazis were
the german officer corps before for was notorious
for its there were numerous scandals which rocked the german
during the late and early many the friends
were prosecuted the kaiser was but the germany army had long
tradition tolerating going far back into prussian history
back frederick the great who was himself roehm was
product this prussian officer and the old german army the
english public school being well known center
would have been quite willing overlook
some nazis complained homosexuality the hitler the
hitler youth swallowed all youth and some the various
and volkish youth groups were known promote
homoerotic ideals and and many homosexuality
seems not unlikely that there were plenty homosexual
regardless the official nazi dogmas concerning the
why should this suprise homosexuality has always all
societies would most unusual the nazis were
have any sources for think the only kind proof you
will accept would citations from archival and not have access
nor intend reread every book the nazis and modern
homosexuality that have ever read have the nothing
stopping from chasing down those until you prove
will stick with the established

that you still unable figure ask
nice kid the local junior high help really

one wonders whether mind warped find sport all
even dredges falsified account

made ass yourself claiming that
was the tradition lent make public announcements
the other
said was the tradition recall and atone for
that made public announcements the others
that were matter public documented

they not see sins what morally upright people see
pointed some them and expressly set whole
your let people point out sins
dean
made ass yourself
saying that statement the tradition tzedukkah was
somehow attempt jews plaster thereby
revealing your inability understand the discussion well
showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about and now you show your intellectual dishonesty
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being and then
claiming ignoring the very argument
what happened was that dean made seem like any jew
who gave alms did other acts charity public was hypocrite
according jewish doing was caricaturing
jewish customs being almost impossibly well
implicitly slandering all jews who make public their acts
went very easily dean for giving him the benefit

much why people hate hate consider
them like anyone sinners all
care about ethnical rights and wrongs
evident that christians consider jews longer the
selected group people while jews consider this
the
christian comes from the obvious fact that the jews should
know the hebrew scriptures better than anyone yet they did not
convert christianity thus rejecting

btw robert take this your post was merely
	the primary problem human nature
humans are state tension good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come
the bible provides with many examples the fragmentation
the warring opposites within are product
rebellion against which described vividly the pages
the
man was created with the order become those were the words
basil the fourth what was trying say was
that god created man partaker the divine the
eastern orthodox this called
one can also say that man was created
and body operating the story adam and eve picture
the archetypal humans before obtaining moral theirs
was harmonious relationship with each the and the
that innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable guilt and fear was manifested
their they become bound and this
symbolized their exile from the paradisiac
the beast the jungle does not possess moral
were receive this the knowledge good and
its paradisiac state would also
was the intention the creator leave man this state
innocence all the days his existence was the gaining
carefully staged who did not desire that his
blissful
god must have known for mankind achieve any kind moral
must pass through confrontation with the there
other way achieve union with
jesus christ the answer the problem the warring
was the perfectly integrated reconciling the
and making possible for become
not his but his
the opposites the christian the apostle paul describes
with the utmost precision romans and follows with the
answer his dilemma

believe that their sins are atoned for with

when was the last time you heard about jewish animal
that their sins are atoned for the blood sacrifice
the blood sacrifice innocent

then why christians follow why they even follow their

posted here that assumed that yours was necessarily the
dale skiba
	dialogue
perhaps you should read and stop advancing the bible evidence relating
questions
jesus
there great fallacy your the question origins
based more than science
science best determining religions handle
and
curious why you and others award custody the baby
and
hope award purposely used order
avoid doing that happens what religions course there are
aberrations like used part indicate
that science currently has time with why and these domains are
mostly also attempted which doubt confused the
for science should have written and nobody
seems argue over
they any better equiped investigate the and
than housewives being athiests
seems that the answer would vary from individual not
trying evasive but from societal religion
the other sometimes abused and and many which
you but the net result seems this from the anthropological
perspective human you might call insofar
think the masses get along without not that generally they are
they just and for myriad but the main one seems
the promise very that therefore
seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for
dispensing answers and suggest that this holds regardless
the their answers who and why simply because people
the spiritual beliefs are just scientific facts and
explanation not take this out
you suggest that the and will forever closed scientific
think closed least for some
there group theoretical physicists who argue that matter was
created from nothing big bang this approach might
presuppose absence who and except that seems could argued
that something had responsible for maybe that something
have maybe just but tough one for
people today any theory without empirical data not
but then your question does not require other
agree that theorizing scientific just scientific
the answer who and why are not closed but
sense that science these realms currently very data will
necessary for and that seems long way pretty
convoluted hope made
seems that years the question the origin life
was not considered open scientific
agree but prefer put this way the
who and why were not open during the
reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers how and
and for the most who and science was thus born out the
eventually carting away the how and when while largely
leaving behind the who and the the the and
the still claim authority all four

	what exciting thread
mitra sanskrit for such started out avatar lord visnu
mentioned first the later seems have risen chief prominence
worshipped the associated with the sun but not the
the lord contract honor and therefore naturally worshipped
was ordered the sun slay the bull heaven and
antly agreed because his blood that bull spilled and
grew all earth mitra and the sun sat down
worship lord mitra ended persia with the ascension the
hundreds years later was rediscovered and thrown into the official roman
pantheon for some forget but all references
him ended abruptly when was stricken from apparently his worship
was some sort vehicle for advancement the like membership
the communist party was the soviet the sociology religion
ancient times
his was
not sure the mystery cult really lasted after his was booted from the
roman imperial god roster contained mostly with levels
they worshipped underground caverns the bull horns
those temples were for scaring away impaling evil not sure
that they had mithraic significance
know that the ritual meal was cannibalistic nature the
christian but eating deities goes way back old kingdom

you better explain what objective atoms and how get them
subjective before any
atoms are not they even what scientists call
atom nothing more than mathematical model that describes
certain observable properties our all

what the approach scientist
takes discussing his model and his there
objective but there objective approach
which subjectively selected the objective
this case means unchanging set rules that
and his colleagues use discuss their
this contrast your objective there may
objective approach subjectively discuss your beliefs
but there exists objective
science deals with how can discuss our observations
the physical world around that the method discussion
objective not the not the discussion itself

	you get and maybe you never many get the
ages and the proclaimed will done they massacred thousands
witch hunts and
there were many injustices the middle and this truely
would hate see day when churches put people death torchured
them for practicing any other the church not
called take over the governments the may that homosexuals
treated cruelly but that does not mean that should teach
christians practice homosexual you think that should
also teach christians practice divination and channelling because
the witches the middle ages were
major flaw all this posturing that the the
effect posts like that yours and hudson that you have
love for change and love this
strange coming from group who claim that god has
one that calls people they
and you accuse when did you look into heart and see
have have been writing that should not teach christians
practice homosexual and you pretend have divine knowledge
look into say that love homosexuals
say that love neighbor should know
very many homosexuals
but jesus loves just loves everyone his love
were not know him should show love
but not love encourage brothers the church
stumble and continue their that very damaging and dangerous
results the passing amendment
has created organization posters are appearing all over
called forget the whole definition off
the last part was against immoral gross homosexual and their motto
for with implicit advocation for
and seems what you and and others are
that could just easily say that nambla has been able
implement legislation make child molesting easier because
the tearing down societies morality due people accepting homosexuality
and that this what you are believe
that homosexual sex that does not mean endorse using violence
against there problem hatred the but there
also the problem what has been called
many the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown
this country and the storm the and have gotten militant
the this truely yet others other churches have
embraced immorality and have pointed the carnality the
conservative churches justify their
just stick the positive and find ways bring people
jesus istead taking bullwhips and driving them
certainly should not use bullwhip drive people from
but water down the gospel draw people jesus
out his way show only what might considered positive aspects
draw people told one man sell all told
another not say good bye his his words were hard
should present people with the cost the tower before allow them

nothing about asked church members some questions about
from the phamphlet and got only deceptive
began notice very similar style for theological
questions the only conclusion could reach was that
these beliefs about the bible were about valid
their beliefs their science
there are still people out there who think that purpose here

that jesus rose from the dead hope that too will rise

pretty much not jew but understand that this the
