	earlier explained that what many people find
arrogant about christians that some christians profess
absolute certainty about their beliefs and
and
the problem that matter how good your sources
any part your doctrines beliefs rest your own
thinking and then those doctrines are
the point that darren raises very lutheran
while reason gift from also infected
yet not reject reason
does need darren himself has pointed
comprehend revelation himself the
but reason alone not sufficient comprehend and believe
the first and for sinful
mind hostile does not submit
can
luther accepted scripture the sole means revelation
but accepted the necessity the use
reason comprehending that
yet luther also regarding mad reason
rushes because baptism not dazzling like
the works which regards
fourth make matters more
luther was the sort theologian that many
people would describe seen him
described
might given these that luther
was inconsistent and surely least some have
come that but might useful
recall that jesus was also called and peter felt
compelled defend himself and the apostles against
charge drunkenness christians
ought careful about rejecting luther
should imitate the who
examined the scriptures every day see what paul
said was true
the basis for the confidence with which and many
others preached the gospel was not just but faith and the holy
this not faith divorced from but faith that
and uses the spirit enables know the
truth and proclaim god does not want preach the
message that think that jesus might have risen from the but
rather know that redeemer the christian
does not side with pilate saying but rather
follows who for this reason was and
for this came into the testify the everyone
the side truth listens
can know the truth because god has promised that can
know the jesus you hold
you are really then you will know the
and the truth will set you the proverbs
urge the and not sell
the psalmist prayed not snatch word truth from
evidently believed that the word truth
was fact his
yet indeed appear arrogant our claim the truth
motivated but present the
truth the teachings revealed the
and not our own and stand ready
proved wrong the basis luther
then are not but should humbly
trust promise just trust his
promise
only because own revelation that can
absolute about
but how far does that get once revelation
and your own reasoning possibility for error
agree that must make distinction between the clear teachings
and the products our own when such
reasoning based however think would draw
the line distinction more and less
than you
for suppose that our modern bible translations
include perfect rendering jesus words the last
and that jesus
presume that what said was totally without error and
absolutely what can certain not
the moment stops and people start
the possibility error did mean
that literally not have any record that
elaborated the was thinking
darren almost the point making very lutheran statement
about the the lutheran approach say
that jesus then that what
should other interpretations are rejected simply because
they are not taught
recall that words not stand alone this also
have words corinthians which passed
what received from the particular
whenever you eat this bread and drink this you proclaim the
death until these words should believe that
the bread that eat the supper really bread well
the our senses fact tell does this
that suppose someone could say that
paul spoke metaphorically the body simply because
that the way the body appears when eat but this thought
found nowhere reject thus the primary
reason for rejecting not that can
prove but that simply not found
been told that the lutheran doctrine real presence
but has been who have told
tend not use the almost think that this
used more professors comparative who need labels
compare lutheran and reformed teachings the
but almost every church wants call their own teaching
because that was the traditional teaching
the
side
when christians speak they believe their own reasoning
can never lead them astray when implicitly claim that
are infallible the christians around rarely believe
that implicit witnessing hardly going work when
the person you are talking believes that you are either too
foolish recognise your own intentionally trying
cover them
this precisely why christians should not rely rationalizations
their far better take the

brothers and
being new the faith and examining the decalogue noticed the
fourth commandment pretty specific about the sabbath
states the saturday the sabbath while most christian religions
atleast church
this frequently asked every time causes
months let see can answer you
basically because the law was given moses part
specific covenanent with the most
part that there was argument early
christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply
gentiles who became you can see the account this
debate acts the main question there was but
keeping the sabbath would part the apostles
concluded that need not become jews order become
and therefore that rules such circumcision did not apply
the law was known man before was revealed mount rom
notes that law there not only
did sin exist before sinai but the sabbath was kept before
was revealed sinai
the problem with the first covenant was not the but the promise
which undergirded god wanted perform his will the lives the
but their ignorance after years they promised
ever says will that why the new covenant
based rather than away with the law
god promised laws their minds and write them their
including the sabbath the acts selective the
sabbath was more important the jews than any attempt
had been made away with the sabbath the reaction would have been
even more strident than recorded acts not confuse the weekly
sabbath the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur
any time the week and were part the law which was
because transgression the moral
israel stands for people all that why god
the gentiles roma says that the the the
the giving the the service god and the promises
belong explanation paul makes clear that being born
into israel not enough they are not all which are
then gal says then are
and heirs according the all christians are
not for that not the
but are joint heirs with jesus based the
promise god made all his people the
while christians agree that the laws not all apply
because some them are part specific covenanent with the
also expect see some similarity between the things god expected
from the jews and the things expects from after the
same however there are several ways dealing with
these days the most common approach separate the commandments
into and ceremonial commandments apply only
the they are part the specific mosaic these are
thinsg like the kosher laws and moral laws apply
most the commands are part the moral except
for the commandment about the believe most people who take
this approach would say that the specific requirement worship
the sabbath part the ceremonial but general obligation
worship regularly part the general moral thus christians
are free choose the specific time
people would probably agree but they are how can the sabbath
commandment ceremonial when part law which predates the
ceremonial you are not free choose your time even
you were why you follow day worship which has its origins pagan
sun would you rather give day which god
and hallowed exchange for one which all church leaders
agree has not biblical foundation sabbath admissions
more radical approach generally connected with john calvin
and the reformed says that the law whole longer
are entirely under and our behavior
should guided solely portions the law are still
useful but they are not properly speaking legally
binding practice most people who take this position not
believe safe leave christians without moral while
may longer under not safe for
into situations with principles guide too good
for that thus christians have moral
from things like
these may not precisely but they serve much the same
function and have largely the same content the
the previous while calvin would deny that have fixed
legal responsibility worship any specific would say that
given human the discipline regular worship
not care what calvin any theologian guide what god
being not under the law means not have keep the
why that the only section the law have trouble with the
sabbath which the only one god thought was important
enough say you study the word deeply you will note that
the message that are longer under the condemnation the law but
freed the grace cop pulls over for then
court ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book but gives
walk out the court saying can now for
now under being under grace now drive within the speed
paul adds then make void the law through
god establish the the law
and the commandment and and
both the specific day not matter
worship sunday memorial
some debate about what acts shows about early
christian the most common analysis that shows jewish
christians continuing jewish services the but
that specifically christian service were not necessarily held
act shows worship the first day and cor also
implies gatherings that
there are few groups that continue believe christians have
worship the sabbath the are the
adventists and they argue that act not
regular worship but special meeting see paul and
that cor explicitly say regular worship
you prefer implication careful study the acts shows
that the meeting was saturday night and that sunday morning paul did
not worship but set off long journey foot
icor there way you can equate him
with worship
clear that this issue was contested one see
rom advice that should very careful about
judging each other issues like one person sees specific
day mandated while another does who observes that
specific day does honor the who believes his
worship free such restrictions also does honor the
who believe that the sabbath still mandated argue
that paul not referring sabbath worship note however col
which says something similar but explicitly
mentions
these are the sabbath days the ceremonial not the sabbath
day the moral
there are some differences among christians about use the word
originally the term referred the the jewish
day many christians now use refer the
day christian they this largely that they can apply
the whatever there are couple different numbering
commandment reformed tradition does not
distinguishes between the sabbath which the observance mandated
for and the day which the free christian
only reference can find this the rev there
are also differences about laws regarding this many christians
support both secular law and church setting aside
that day and causing people spend the more radical
approach sees such regulations return the jewish
which not appropriate the free christian worship the
why would you prefer twist and relying different arguments
which conflict with each rather than obey simple request from
god who loved you enough die for jesus died because the law could
not why bother die order meet the demands
broken law all you need change the penalties for law
breaking means the law that why sin not
follow the demands the ceremonial will always sin
make false violate break the
except you but then your opinion has weight
when placed next the word
darius
not clear how much more needs said other than the
think comments esteeming one day over another
probably all that needs accept that darius doing
what does honor the just wish might equally
accept that those who all days are similarly doing
their best honor the
however like clear that not think unambiguous
proof that regular christian worship was the first
there are responses both the passages
the difficulty with both these passages that they are actually
about something they both look like they are talking about
nnregular christian but neither explicitly says they
gathered every sunday for get various pieces
but nothing aimed answering this
act describes christians participating both jewish temple
worship and christian communion services obviously the
temple worship the acts example
christians participating unfortunately tell
what day christians met their acts despite
described acts occuring see
reason impose modern definitions when days when the
biblical text clear about what was the wording implies
that this was normal say they gathered
see paul but that when they were gathered for breaking
paul talked about his upcoming but just not explicit
enough really similarly with cor says
that the first day they should set aside money for
now you want believe that they gathered specially
that they did their disprove
but the obvious time for congregation take offering would
when they normally gather for and they were expected
their homes there would reason mention specific
think the most obvious reading this that the first day
every simply means every time they gather for
think the reason have only implications and not clear statements
that the authors assumed that their readers knew when christian
worship
	this not science collection models telling
not something cannot see any good reason why the
questions would bound only natural assuming that the

beg disagree with the assertion that science collection
scientific models are game and are only good the
assumptions and measurements that into
remember when nuclear winter was the big hype
atmospheric long after admonitions that
one our boys was adding another level reality into his model
the nuclear winter scenario erl decided assume
that the atmosphere more like than
dimensional also assumed that rained and that the winds
blow the real returning georgia showed
transparency atmospheric cooling rates according the year they
were generated the there was unmistakable correlation
between the age simplicity remoteness
from each model and the degree whereas
model showed approximate cooling the next model
sophistication showed about half and until got
our which showed degree drop the war happened
the winter and less than degree drop happened the
predicted that when would include the presence
the and other indicators reality the would
probably see even less thus nuclear winter was reduced even
less than nuclear one might nuclear
quote from
the postulated models have become accepted the reality
instead the lattice assumptions they
authoritarianism dominates the and very critical
analysis each argument skepticism
the model approach earth problems warranted because
many key parameters have not been
this statement surely applies equally well only when
convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results
may one suggest that the model may describe the just thought

how the word the fact that does not
mean anything christians other than feast day the resurrection

the meaning word what people understand
and the same goes for other cultural the festival easter

	commited christian that battling with know
romans talks about how are saved our faith not our yet
and james say that faith without deeds you
you still think that just believing
actually think there any conflict really understand
what these passages what you study the
meaning the greek and hebrew words translated think you will
come the conclusion that the word means more than mere
faith means both trust and you not put your
belief into action simply cannot qualify think this
what james means when says that without works
will show you faith remember james was
writing twelve tribes which are scattered this
probably means was writing those who would hear the gospel much
later and understand the meaning the original
suspect james was writing among others
intended the other hand wrote mostly the
people the roman empire who generally understood the meaning
the
another key why there conflict look
statements their think you will find that when paul
contrasts faith and works the context comparing the
gospel with the meaning the law this was the great
burden the apostle the gentiles would
convert bunch then the would come along and
try convince them that they also had obey the law moses
acts chapter this context paul condemns the idea being
saved the works the saying that are saved the blood
jesus and our faith believe that better translation
for today would that are saved think
today has meaning closer what the original
writers
someone fully believing but there life totally lead themselves
not according romans that person still saved there
think you misunderstand what paul really saying
that god prefers faithful gentile who does not
kosher jew who fails stay faithful the more important matters
following the lord and having charity toward his
then there the bit which says that god preferes someone who cold
know him lukewarm christian someone who
and believes god but make any attempt live the
the sense faith described you cannot have real faith and
you know god but are lukewarm you are
worse off than the person who never heard jesus
the parable the pearl great price and again
the one the treasure hidden the field indicates that
the price the kingdom god
agree with you including the fact that has
some the force however you take that too
you can end with something that paul definitely would not have
being faithful means following god all say
that are saved being faithful very close saying that
are saved commiting assume not what you
have almost given finding specific verbal formula that
completely captures however think paul describing what
call basic including aspects such trust and
jesus speaks which implies basic
may still things that are and may fail show
the new life christ many situations where but any
christian there had better the basic change orientation that
jesus calls being born
	heres the life maria posted with kind permission

saved there
yes and not believe the above scenario not
either they are believing and living least some led else
they are believing but not
especially important remember that one can judge whether you are
nor can you judge someone guess the closest can
come know situation listening their own this
can our sense communion one with

preferes someone who cold him know him
lukewarm christian someone who knows and believes god but
make any attempt live the
regarding this need remember that this letter church
people who are the body talks
about their translation could say that says their lack
concern makes him sick the point throwing
now the opinion that you saved through faith alone what
you taught but how can square mind the
teachings james conjunction with the lukewarm christian being
saving faith except that faith does not come
you catch the two
can offer the explanation that jesus would that were either fire

who rejected their messiah and had him john refers them
afraid refers the church that christ many

they will
but think this interpretation the matthew parables
stands for for example

ideas about how choose
colossians
jesus the head the the church
you cannot say but the church
ephesians
the church the family god
the church based the word god only
testament
testament revelation
corinthians
baptism when become member the church
for the question
the bible teaches that there only one church from ephesians
romans corinthians
corinthians says that there should divisions
the there should following personalities the church
their
there are many churches today because timothy
says that people will turn away from the truth and try find
church that teaches doctrine that suits their lifestyle
hebrews
not miss church
purpose encourage each will remain
involved relationship level the church
must come all services
another verse which helpful hebrews the church should
encouraging their duty
more standards
timothy people the church should watching their lives
and doctrines make sure they both live the word entirely
acts the pastor does not come close the apostle paul
conclusion since the apostle paul talked with jesus directly
face the who were considered take
paul his word but checked out what said with scripture verify
his then church members are the same and verify the
they are not verifiable valid light
other then that group should avoided church
made wonderful suggestion the waco especially light
matthew
joe fisher
	called has claimed that there way out the but
did not bother explain what preferring instead paraphrase
ramble about and say that the conclusion argument
will answer this find
suggested that people read there and not
think very highly but think that
schaeffer grossly overrated many evangelical somebody
might like let opinion stop you from reading
someone interested suggest
any substantial number readers read some
the postings would they
some would michael siemon
notice what said about this called the reason
dropped philosphy major was because ran into too many pharisaical
know how many walking ran across
philosphy the problem knowing sooooo much more than your
average lay the problem comes when you become puffed about
schaeffer just fine for the average lay that was who was
writting suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was
talked with schaeffer one been lectures with
the man when was being drilled philosphy students and from secular
well christian alone would fill both those
his answers were enough that the themselves often were taken back and
caused what their question saw this time and time again
different open schaeffers books are
certainly grad level but must get off our
high horses when comes recommended you seriously think most
people would get through the first chapter may have more
say about this secular scientist another
one must finally get beyond the doubt caused
one cannot live his life constantly from cartisian doubt
the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine but must
add qualification give this christianity second none
keeping reason its never know the value thing until know
its put unlimited value something and the end you will exhaust
all
this why xianity thoroughly rational but not the least bit
also explains the curious fact that and not christian
which leads forget the limits
fly the face reality and condem ourselves learn the simple ironic
lesson
without limits less with limits
have often stated freedom without form soon becomes form
put another the rationality faith implacably opposed
absurdity but has quarrel with think about can tell the
difference between the two you will let contention with
rationalism not that has too much reason but that has very
little when christian comes faith his understanding and his trust
hand but continues faith his trust may sometimes called
itself without his
this where the principle suspended judgment such time the
christian faith itself and let god must suspend judgment
and not understand you but trust now read all
your objections into that saying not understand
you but trust you means that not understand you
this but understand trust therefore can
trust that you understand even though the former mystery
unrelieved rationality and indistinguishable from the latter
statement rationality faith walking hand hand with the mystery
the principle suspended judgment not
not leap faith but walk believers cannot always know
but canalways know why trust god who knows why and this makes all
the
there one obvious snag all this and this where have parted
company with what eminently reasonable theory rather bit
more difficult practice the pressure mystery acts faith
like the insistent year just that would like
know what not know but that feel know what cannot
the one produces frustration because curiosity the other
leads genuine more specifically the poorer our understanding
coming faith the more necessary will understand everything after
coming not know why trust then will always need
know exactly what god doing order trust failing grasp
may not able trust for anything not understand may
count decisevely against what are able
the other know why trust will able trust
him situations where not understand what many xian
leaders teach the christian had window the back his head which
allows for understanding every foot for what god doing may
but will not inherently may mystery
but mystery only what would insufferable
and that was the conclusion nietzche both theory and
	may really dumb but ask
know that they can never live the requirements
may but that but they still
seem like are spending all our lives
reach goal can never know that are saved
and not but does that mean that once are saved
think james tells that faith without works
how does this
long think that good things are what rather than
come miss the the more love the
come love what and whom
find that what doing not not sign try
harder sign seek when aware
usually want what his his love
empowers
religious studies saint
apologize the but the first quote was deleted and
would like respond
for the can never the reward comes from the
paul makes clear claim that are continue straining for
the prize over philippians only not living out the
commands stagnate and become spit out
says john love for obey his
that obedience our straining achieve for this
requires work our
for the quote satan care what what
matters the results our belief one truly has faith
what one one will either act that faith lying
oneself about believing the first
for your first you have very good obedience
obligation not what god look how
many times the bible talks about being joyous all situations and when
doing being begrudged the work has
should the work necessary whenever not just when feel
feelings can deceive paul states
timothy timothy the prepared season and
out rebuke and great patience and
careful remember that paul tells timothy
timothy your life and doctrine persevere
because you you will save both yourself and your
order the work need sure that are
correct remember warning matthew not
hypocritical about what the best way accomplish this

	palm sunday our were take the role
the declined last year the
meeting pointed out how crucify christ our
appropriate that retain the role the but
and new things are introduced the course the
and since one knows the new things have
and pretty soon instead lot the mass just
there listening spacing how the mass about
lay the blame liturgy committees made lay
aware the
former catholic and now very active lutheran some the
the mass which made leave the catholic church and return
the more traditional catholic chuch the
spent many years lector reading the passion parts appropriate
the catholic church and found very our lutheran parish just
instituted the service for good friday and was the lector for
paraphrased passion which was heard and learned things
that have previously overlooked the gospels yet those were
always matter the pastor and were talking about
the differences between the and lutheran church during holy week over
breakfast easter
member liturgy can tell you that the problem
certain people who want try out all kinds
the priests seem even make any
their own many guess easier
than refuse allow
wife the member the liturgy committee the family music
and worship our our pastor does have control this committee
but listens very carefully the needs strong
hand lead and keep the intent and the message clear and strong
should through lent and the rest the liturgical additional
reason for leaving the catholic faith lack any selfless spiritual
guidance priests aka
you may gather from feel that very
regardless denominational have which promotes
the true reason that are gathered quite comfortable
traditional with receiving holy communion the the sacrament
penance stations the and
the reason other types masses and parishes exist because these feelings
are not shared
want more people attend church and find the but want
them attending church works hard have meaningful
service during lent but follow traditional lutheran book
worship where things are changed omitted during lent
the hymn noted that are aware the reasons that
not
quite very hard for mass and
dear wife never could and holy week masses and vigils
would intimidate the daylights out those catholics who
have beared with this far understand what
please keep mind why are there gather together not
worry about how something done not there something
wrong that you feel needs all means talk your priest
have only ever met one who they are there
provide spiritual guidance and use differences with
the catholic church are much more fundamental but decision change
faiths was done with and sessions with priests and
kershner
kershner wyatt
opinions are own and necessarily
	anybody out there see the current emphasis the
being turned into
debated this quite and while think legitimate
for the planet great can easily see
perverted into something
many pagans are involved only since
respect for the earth fundamental tenet all pagan this
mean that environmentalism any more than supporting peace
the middle east wrong because jews and muslims also work for
paganism certainly the and christians should
address this and look what draws people from paganism like
pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should
and
believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity has
this mean that paganism but does mean that
have something learn from the pagan
paganism respects the christianity has long history
oppressing and many not male christians are still unable
live the idea that god that christ
could have been women and still accomplished his met with great
deal this insistance theology the
society that goes with drives away many young women who have
had put with sexist attitudes their
paganism respects the physical this idea with great
one these for our surroundings
and our another integration christianity has long
tradition calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people suppress
and deny their this too clearly part human
experience and attempting remove simply not feasible
christianity has only begun develop workable sexual and paganism
attractive
not advocating that christian doctrines sex before
should that christians work toward more moderate ethic
denial sexuality places much emphasis sex unmoderated
and neither one does much bring closer

innappropriate emphasis god deserves our love and worship
who not like the idea frightening people into
and read the gospels and particular the topics that jesus
himself spoke hell figures large the time more than
heaven learn taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate teach hell and
chapter very specific and cannot think the word
used times rev and that the unbelieving come receive the
assignment the severity for john read that they are
already rom speaks that every mouth will there
excuse
see evangelism combining way living that shows love with
into words and explaining that preaching the gospel
living the gospel better than being noisy gong
yes agree with life often like pendulum where swings
extremes before stopping think have seen the extreme
the fire but also have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about all for fear offending someones
forget who founded the word life but remember him telling
was small town hardware store and some how man got the
point telling him that believe satan believed
everybody was going was this point that the man was asked
pray god that would send his children course the man
but the point was many people say they believe
hell but they are not willing really place their faith that
this man would prayed the prayer because hell
exist and there would have been fear having his prayer and
they walk they believe they will never sent
use different illustration have include myself
when say basketball and see blatant foul that
with that ref that make that
and just righteousness demands the
surgeon takes knife hand cut the cancer god cuts off that which
still the old must preach the gospel all its richness
which includes the fact that you reject the way and the truth and the
then broad the way
how many you are christians because you are
going how many are responding
think would fall there actually was after
repentance only turning but also turning away
jesus used his ministry then can surely see that
should but truth most
have thought about writing something this but not now and
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
god yes but his love has the boundary

think that melinda complaining about the basis christian
there tendency among christians have all the
answers because god gave them this simply not the

revelation
	not clear how much more needs said other than the
comments esteeming one day over another
all that needs
was paul god interpretation the words paul higher
priority than the direct word jesus paul begins
romans with someone weak the faith you count
yourself one who weak the
accept that darius doing
does honor the just wish might equally
that those who all days are similarly doing
best honor the
but what does the bible have what did jesus paul
closes romans the other the person with doubts about
something who eats anyway because acting his
and any failure act faith
have you read the ten commandments which are portion the have
you read word there any doubt your mind
about what right and what sin hamartia missing the
like clear that not think unambiguous
that regular christian worship was the first
there are responses both the passages
the ten commandments and words are fairly
are they
difficulty with both these passages that they are actually
something they both look like they are talking about
christian but neither explicitly says they
every sunday for get various pieces
but nothing aimed answering this
answer your
day christians met their acts despite
described acts occuring
they gathered
paul but that when they were gathered for breaking
breaking bread roughly synonymous with
think the most obvious reading this that the first day
every simply means every time they gather for
how you unite this concept yours with the ten commandments and
word
think the reason have only implications and not clear statements
that the authors assumed that their readers knew when christian
they assumed that the ten commandments and word
actually stood for perhaps they were
the
believe that paul can overrule however paul was
writing for largely gentile the law was regarded jews
the time binding but not there
are rules that were binding all human beings noachic
but they are quite the issue that the church had
face after death was what about gentiles who wanted
follow the decision not impose the law them say
that the law was simply acknowledged that fact that
apply thus there contradiction with mat
far can both paul and other jewish christians did
continue participate jewish worship the thus they
continued obey the the issue was with gentile
who are not covered the law least not the
ceremonial aspects
jesus dealt mostly with think can reasonably assume that
mat was directed jewish did interact with
gentiles few times the centurion whose slave was healed and
couple the terms used describe the centurion luke
suggest that was gentile who followed
but had not adopted the whole jewish was commended
jewish elders worthy and jesus accepted him
this seems indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view
that gentiles need not accept the
however more involved you want compare jesus and paul
the order get full picture the role the
have come grips with apparent rejection the and
how that relates commendation the least
read says that the law serves purpose that has been
certain sense this issue one the
abolition the the middle his paul notes
that might understood this and assures that not
what intends sees the law primarily being
present convict people their but ultimately
impossible and one that has been superceded
comments are not the clearest and not everyone
agrees with but the interesting thing notice that
even this radical position does not entail abolition the
still remains uncompromising from which not iota
dot may for its purpose convicting
important that not however for not
the end ultimately live not
while the theoretical categories they use are rather the
end think jesus and paul come rather similar the
quoted passage from mat should taken the context the rest
the sermon the where jesus shows how interprets the
the iota would suggest rather literal
but fact not interpretations
emphasize the intent the and stay away from the ceremonial
indeed well known for taking rather free attitude
towards the sabbath and kosher some scholars claim that mat
needs taken the context jewish
jesus accuses his opponents caring about giving
tenth even the most minor but neglecting the things that
really mercy and and caring about how cups and
plates are but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full extortion and and
the discussion later mat suggest that jesus has very specific
view the law and that when talks about maintaining the
law its full thinking these aspects
conclusion while talks about the law being
all the specific examples gives involve the
such circumcision and the quite
concerned about maintaining moral
the net result this that when paul talks about the law being
and jesus talks about the law being believe
they are talking about different aspects the paul
embroiled arguments about natural letters
responding specific looking the aspect the
law that currently causing the law specifically jewish
certainly does not intend abolish divine standards
the other when jesus commends the seems
talking the law its broadest implications for morals and
human and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
give paul much
unfortunate that people use the same terms different but
should familiar with that from current look the
way terms like take special meaning from the
current imagine some poor historian the future trying
figure out why should used code word for
opposition homosexuality one specific period the
think law had taken similar role the arguments paul was
involved paul was clearly not rejecting all the jewish values
that along with the term any more than people who concerned
about the movement are really opposed family

	cannot from that the weekly sabbath part the
before you post text reply investigate its
first extrascriptural sometimes
used framework view but you look
without going into with the assumption that the sabbath cannot
ceremonial you will see that does refer the
paul writes collosions how that christ nailed the laws that were
against his and therefore should not judged what
what food what the keeping new moons and holy
the keeping the
the word for sabbath this verse and used throughout the
new testament refer the there any scripture from
which get the idea the ceremonial this one and the
sabbath listed among the ceremonial
one goes into this with the fundamental assumption sabbath cannot
ceremonial then will have find some way around like
saying that this can only refer the other sabbath holy days besides the
because sabbath cannot ceremonial but
paul very careful his letters add some kind parenthetcal
statement there anything that can seen liscence sin
his
why the sabbath absent from the epistles for hebrews which
talks about the rest that comes through surely would have
been big problem for first century christians living society
that did not rest the especially many new converst were

not hand any more than the first martyr
the problem was that one believed the then one
must believe jesus truly being the son god and what
stood for and preached during his ministry that would
have been extremely difficult for some especially those
that had plotted kill
the basic problem with your argument your total and complete reliance
the biblical account highly suspect would refer you

stronger understanding the true this immediacy was cause
hardship for much that who seen with heavens resting
his but this not merely the physical heavens that
put god and the strict spirituality his law and
thus became the the this made men able
heaven were afar off and either the god heaven could not
see through the dark did not regard with displeasure the breakers
his interesting see that was that was titled
was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system
and abridged the liberties yet was worship for having given many
was deliverer all right but not think christ

question what happens human beings who died before christ
ever present one with not ready consign adam

see the from the time those who looked forward
the coming and put their faith the fact that was god who

possible experience eternity passing the
eternity duration not simply one indefinitely

agree with you our say
clearly clearer than that say but that not what was referring
this point should acknowledge openly debt the work rudolf
founder for many insights that have led
this
way you refer puts modern intellectual coloring
think was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually
teaching that struck much closer home than our doctrines
today can
understand you have this was
not ready attribute widespread notions antiquity

the question what extent did they reflect real perception
this this the big would again

the different ideas the time immediately
death testifies the presence underlying
that but two edged for some not want the
underlying reality they were not known religions
for there was the public side them and there was the private
that was protected that the initiates oath death they
revealed that private that why hard bring their teachings
the that find the correlates
this the primary object the mysteries was introduce
little under the seal secrecy and sanction what would
not have been safe openly profess was the true case point
today might the that they too worshipped osiris
who can traced the
the other there one notion firmly embedded christianity
originated most definitely pagan the idea that the
being consists essentially soul and that the soul
was consciously adopted from whose ideas
christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does
disagree with you here know what alluding that the
primarily the did endorse aristotelian philosophy into their
but would disagree with you that originated you
are student you will come see that much what greece came
expound the world their was just adulteration that which
they had taken from conquered the soul clearly mentioned and
discussed length the egyptian was the unity god and also
the trinity see you can find really
does number what the greeks did what they from the
was once the father modern thought and the same
lived during that darkened time when the perception our
spiritual being had grown
not knocking aristotle plato any other greek its just that
nothing new under the
should also clarify that not deny that eternal
damnation real but the narrow range
conceive the decisive after the end
earthly not mind sufficient embrace the
and think that why the early creeds were couched
that did not try spell
each age has its own focus the early church struggled with the
trinitarian the reformation dealt with
eschatology has had much the early creeds not spell these things out

first resent your assumption that you know why
threatened even that threatened
although admit the the reason threatened science
has nothing with need for proof
god reveals himself many some
problem with science that often allows
assume know what best for god endowed
with the ability produce life through sexual
for but did not make that availible
does that mean that science can decision
through that god wills for have the power
decide who should and should not able have
should men allowed have that
made
people have always had the ability end lives
and soon may have the ability bring lives
into the world the closest thing artificially
created life artificially created and god
has reserved judgement about when people should die
believe should rely wisdom about how
people should brought the
this not say that reject all forms
medical treatment that alleviates
prevents pain from perfectly
was acceptable for jesus
cure the treatment that merely
prolongs life for makes unnecessary
alterations the body for mere aesthetic
too are not happy with the beauty god
gave
cannot draw solid line regarding where
would approve scientific and where would
but will say before one experiments with the
universe find out all its one should ask
why they want this before one alters the body
they have been they should ask themseles why their
body not satisfactory too them cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the but
will say that each person should pray for guidance

should cease their unravelling they have reason

	aaron bryce cardenas
the writings make the old the
make the new these recorded the
the foundation the
seems most peculiar interpretation the the and
were rather than and there were new testament
who built the
remember the doctrine perhaps the prophets
testified the testified
after what does prophesy what
especial who suppose personal that means
true one must have christ appear now lets see
when did the church quit claiming
	all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer both questions
have different definitions absolute
absolute something that constant across
true every instance you agree
this think you
all truth truth
contradiction when something when always
not always then have
contradiction
agree with carol determining absolutes practically
waste and easily forget that relative truth fact
for recently was asking some children the question temperature
does water boil got the answer degrees asked
they knew what and was told just any
what all thermometers and may
true the experience the but simply not
absolute scripture full which should
nurture and but trying determine which parts are absolute truth
and which parts are the manifestations that the context the time
and culture which the text was penned missing the then religion
easily becomes intellectual devoid the living experience
the indwelling trinity and becomes dead
church
this was good there may absolute truth behind the
but the simplest understanding the passage that the
instructions apply the and not necessarily
the instructions may reflect absolute truth the context first
century culture and the particular climate which was having
lot trouble with absolute truth and
see even reason that should
are clearly not taking this particular part scripture
absolute there are plenty other
you reconcile
even the most literalists not take all the bible
yet meet anyone who takes the verse who takes your
babies and smashes their heads against the the bible
was not printed handed god with color codings tell
what parts should interpreted which
many people claim that there are absolutes the such
statement terribly let put you this
there are conclude that the
are not absolutely have
contradiction
claim that there are think there are very
and determining absolutes
very and even knew may not
able express that way that still conveys absolute truth
the presence absence absolutes may not make any since
know can never fully apprehend absolute walks and greets
hardly even evangelical
mention the rest regarding
people sometimes disagree about what this does not negate
the that there are still absolutes the
prove the existence can only rely upon
also trust revelation that cannot fully comprehend the
therefore comprehend the need
can never know the essence only the energies and through which
god manifested the reality can that there are
but practical like claiming that the
original scriptural autographs were but copies may not
who affect any practical useful might
well believe that god has made lot electric blue and that they
live maybe god that going have any effect
how deal with whether not this that

this attitude leads many believe that all christians
are arrogant idiots incapable critical christianity

says that immaculate mother the ever virgin
having completed the course her earthly was assumed
and soul into heavenly this was defined papal
though had certainly been believed some
like the immaculate this primarily
catholic and like has direct biblical
note that catholics not believe
they not believe that the bible the only source
thus the fact that doctrine has little
support not necessarily significant they believe
truth can passed through traditions the and also
can revealed the not interested yet
but any catholics can tell
basis for these think would
that generally but contains one serious catholics
believe that revealed truth that not explicitly recorded
the bible can and passed through the tradition the
should noted that the tradition the otherwise known
sacred not the same ordinary human
not believe that additional truth will revealed
the public which the basis catholic
ended with the death the last nothing new can

that signifies death not this
the reason for the agony the for the first time one
member the godhead was separated from the other
once met young lady that was beautiful any model that ever
she was personable any saint ever she was become
for several having been were
separated that was form she decided
that she wait for come home and bid that was
was separation from that which had made death
separation and eternal death eternal separation from his not
because chose send you into outer but because you chose
did you know that jesus talked more
about hell than did about
you for this what respect had for the man now
has been diminished promise never again
say how wise loving this man
when rebelled against earthly spanked found wisdom
that until had grown older and especially until had own
was trying guide away from hurt that would enter life continued
suicidal did love though interpreted harsh and
god warns impending that choose let
and then the end tell the that would
you have matter how calused fallen that witnesses
you that thing wrong and that there cause for
jesus was allegedly doubt could honestly feel
the pinpricks man dealt
this may give light the error your one must have correct

for not have high priest who cannot sympathize with our
but one who has been tempted all things yet without
the kenosis passage phil states that gave his godhead attributes
when took upon himself has been favorite meditation mine
think about was phd consciousness
have talked length with great many people about this
interesting including
conclussion that the member the actually
suffered became part the human race and experienced
chose not grasp his but chose

extent that sometimes hard distinquish between jesus the man and

each person chooses what skeptical about and what

underlines the point that one can know exhaustively how knows what

the answer this impasse lies way one which based

	good and reasonable statements
the atheist position seems that there are this
reasonable assertion but leads practical
you reject all authority out you reject all possibility
every receiving thus the atheist position can never possibly
and therefore
this not the position that there proof the
existence much some people accept their their priests
straight from their own scriptures the this does not
satisfy
atheists believe recognisable they were dogmatic
you claim they they would trying prove every time they
got what they dispute that scriptures
represent true authorities and know the
demand scintific rational proof deny
since neither nor their very
prove
are you asking believe you are trying deny that part
that makes ask the question god and
not use our ability reason become ignorant

you are right that science and reason cannot prove
not use them can only then believe faith and since
can only use why one picture any less

	jesus really descended from david the messiah was supposed
have joseph but christians say that joseph related
jesus
you look the geneology christ luke and the one
you will notice that they trace different lines back
have been told that one traces line back david and the other
line back them beyond david
acording some jewish passed
child the mother and the legal rights are passed
the true that one these geneologies
then bloodline from david through his this
means that christ had all the legal rights decendant
according least roman law possibly mosaic law
but not joseph was legal
the argument for genealogy being that mary very according
luke
and when began his jesus himself was about
thirty years being supposedly the son
the son
aside from the fact that mary not there are two possible
either joseph was her father was her
clearly this not third would that the son
was her father and just happened have the name the man
whom she was but that would seem grasping
the most straightforward interpretation that luke had
intention tracing genealogy which case would have
named but that traces her from son
the matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from
matthew
and jacob was born the husband whom was born
who called
there are two apparent the first how reconcile the
two paternal genealogies which diverge with the sons
solomon and the second why any genealogy joseph
relavent joseph had nothing with joseph was
not physical then the original poster quite
that claims for messianic heritage are not based
truth but only whatever divine nature
the second problem assume that joseph was not
involved the conception jesus any holy
spirit capable working physical conception mary also
capable employing the physical agency seed this
our materialistic times interpret viginity and its loss
solely terms physical whereas really matter
purity much higher level the important thing that
neither mary nor joseph was conscious any union between them
had not thus the first dedication
half its opening chapter the genealogy joseph quite relevant
the virgin birth
the first question there answer that begin more
problems than that the two evangelists are relating
the births two entirely different children two entirely different
sets except for the names the parents and the and
the birthplace bethlehem there point common between the two
matthew and luke converge their accounts only thirty years
later with the baptism jesus rudolf steiner offered his
explanation how these accounts begin with two children and then converge
with their accounts the one jesus did not derive his
resolution from biblical study from other external
and the discussion this could might bring beyond
the limits appropriateness for this any the
details are described spiritual guidance the human
being and gospel and gospel
whether not rudolf methods and explanation are accepted
least this interpretation resolves the apparent
contradictions the two genealogies while leaving the text
for the passing jewishness through the this was
never issue with one ever questioned his

line descent from the

talked how great felt that god had made such pretty and how
nice was give people she then said she was getting married
she talked about how she and her husband had very little may not have
even had for all but that they felt very special love
the unselfish kind warmed heart know that
people can have little and realize that spiritually they are

not clear how much more needs said other than the
comments esteeming one day over another
all that needs accept that darius doing
does honor the just wish might equally
that those who all days are similarly doing
best honor the
myself sda and total agreement with what darius has
also worship saturday honor the your mention
all days imo has with the fast days observed the but
matter how you interpret that accept your worship sunday
being done honor the contrast with what many fellow
sda believers may the bible overwhelmingly points
saturday the day kept honor creation and
deliverance the israelites from egyptian those who would
attempt point out that observance saturday being
this simply not the keeping saturday allows full day
rest and contemplate goodness and
like clear that not think unambiguous
that regular christian worship was the first
there are responses both the passages
with cor says
the first day they should set aside money for
now you want believe that they gathered specially
that they did their disprove
the obvious time for congregation take offering would
they normally gather for and they were expected
their homes there would reason mention specific
the idea was introduced once that the reason paul wanted the
corinthians lay aside money for the collection the first day the
week was because that was when they received their weekly paul
wanted them lay aside money for the collection first before
spending their money other not have any proof front
for this although would explain why they would lay aside money
their homes instead
think the most obvious reading this that the first day
every simply means every time they gather for
think the reason have only implications and not clear statements
that the authors assumed that their readers knew when christian
would seem that you assume that the christians the regularly
worshipped the first assume that the christians the
regularly worshipped the seventh but agree with you that only
have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip
	think belief right and everyone belief
have this simply what belief
this seems how christians are taught think when
comes their some take the extreme and say that
their religion the only one and you accept their teachings
then you takes quite bit arrogance claim
know what god especially when based upon your
interpretation the logic the above statement faulty
that assumes two people with differing beliefs both
all about two people are exactly
two people perceive everything the same believe that
there one call universal call
what you believe god presents this think
just there and you look for and see through
dreams just because people may
perceive this truth mean one wrong and the
other take the the glass half
empty half you can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are for your belief
does not require everyone belief
person has what they believe convincing evidence that god
will save only hard see how you can criticize them
for arrogance for saying could that but
hardly see that look this bit

but say anything about believe
and then add anybody who believes anything else
then you could well criticize for but this case the
exclusivity the message comes from the
could wrong believing but see how can

tend view prayer use and sign the
speaking tongues during service not usually done
because for the most they still attend protestant
churches seem view the use sign
merely but
just couple minor corrections
the churches christ not usually believe speaking
fact many them are known for being strongly opposed
pentecostal you are probably thinking church god
the largest pentecostal
not sure what you mean but
should pointed out that the assemblies god does not nor has
held that speaking tongues the sign that one
the doctrine that traditional pentecostals the maintain
that speaking tongues the sign second experience after becoming
christian which one the holy that may
what you were referring but point this out because pentecostals are
frequently labeled believing that you have speak tongues order
such position only held some groups and not the
majority many pentecostals will quote the passage
mark about signs following them that but they generally
not interpret this meaning you pactice the signs you
know hard summarize the beliefs movement that
has such but think made some pretty big
generalizations only believe tongues
sign and tongues prayer but not tongues revelatory with
never heard that fact would have characterized them
believing the same pentecostals except less likely see tongues

nothing christianity that precludes the idea
repeated lives
apostle paul points out that god chose jacob
than esau the ancestor the covenant people and
the and that made this choice while the
boys were still their and therefore could not
have done anything good evil deserve their appointed
admit the possibility that they had lived previous
and that accordance with the asiatic idea
present lives are reward punishment for past
makes nonsense whole
the existence repeated earth lives and destiny does not
mean that everything that happens predetermined past
there oriental view that tends that but
did not subscribe that god may choose one individual over
another the fit instrument for his but that does not
preclude that the development that individual into what
this earthly life not the result longer course
and rudolf steiner did subscribe the oriental view
mechanistic karma determining everything that
befalls this kind shriveled caricature much greater
law the context which the deed christ golgotha and the
ultimate salvation and freedom the human being working
christ can seen the master theme new impulse that
was completely free christ incarnated only once the
and that had debt karma the oriental
concepts reincarnation and which are even more trivialized
and mechanized some new age incorrectly assume jesus
christ have been the reincarnation
their teaching reincarnation and karma also has concept the
continuing individuality from one life the next
more they have concept the resurrection the
the ultimate continuity the whole human being ultimate
resurrection and judgement the last
there another biblical passage that also has the
tenth chapter devoted almost entirely the man born
clearly jesus tells the disciples that was not his past karma
that his parents that led his but rather that
new impulse revealed through but note that does not
refute the they ask matter
the question being stated were self evident that only
one two possibilities existed was either the sins the man
obviously not this the sins his
the fact that they even asked about the first possibility
all indicates awareness the idea their part and the form
answer indicates that did not disagree with
there also matthew where jesus says straight out about john
the
you care accept himself who was
this also emphasizes that the gospels not have positive teaching
either way about reincarnation about what happens
the human being all between death and the last even jesus did
not push this teaching people who were not ready embrace
you care accept took care point not that the
bible teaches reincarnation but that does not deny and
that much both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes
understandable reincarnation understood the right
pointedly used earth distinguish little from the
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word
the phrase rudolf noted too
that the idea needed arise new insight the completely
free from eastern did the eighteenth and nineteenth
the most important expression being
education the human
return your original statement about jacob and
esau does not contradict the idea repeated earth lives and
and both these principles receive their fulfillment the

	have stated before that not consider myself but
definitely not believe the christian the recent discussion
about atheists and combined with post another group the
effect will all has interested the consensus
how god might judge was told that
might but obviously some people not
believe even more see atheists and pagans assume would
lumped into this know you believe only
god can and not ask you just for your
excellent question hpoe the answers you get will satisfactory
can not understand the mind but attempt answer you
god the bible has given humans relativly little about how
intends judge the first test those who have beleived that jesus
christ the son god and that his death and resurrection was sufficent
serve justice for all the acts commit that are wrong the eyes
the bible calls this for those who die before the end the
already died more complicated explain without lapsing
god must judge people the baasis their works this however
there plus and minus system for has declared that can not
tolerate spiritual thus can only based your worthiness
live with him the wrong your
good yes even christians are going constantly sin before the
christian hoever thanks god that christ has given his life for his
the proscribed punishment for sin just the proscribed
punishment for robbery time god then cannot ask for anything but
punishement for those does not want the bible says john
that god did not send his son the word condem but that
through him might when realize that have and
with painful must approach god and ask him not hold thew sin
against have that right and privlige only because for jews
they are promised that they must believe the messiah who would and
dis come jesus fear have been given lie from the
fater they need christ
for those who have that the view the bible they stand
olone their are you going can not answer that for
can only say that perhaps eaiser ask and answer how can not
that step much more

divorced chance would have that with
daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this
although had married catholic decided
that the catholic moray indoctrination the spouse into the faith
was too confining restrictive due time had already set
and were married christian church which was
during the years our did not often attend
when our daughter was some years wife insisted that she
baptised this problem with
during separation five was taken ill with disease
that affected her mental she was confined mental ward for
two months before was has since been treated
other professionals have deemed her functioning member
during the has embraced her influence over
daughter has been and has primarily allowed only saturday
visitation for number during this period have read bible study
books and tried keep her aware her christian
last our divorce was finalized after year viscious divorce
that time was awarded visitation rights every other that
started taking daughter church quite although not every
did this attempt strengthen the christian ethic and expose her
religious
easter took daughter when came time for
daughter took the bread body but left the wine
blood professing that she was too young for she then
balled the bread her hand and tried descretely throw under the
pew front
feel this was slap the face and afront her
religious can construed breaking several the commandments
you really felt dishonored the
daughter only nine years but think she should have been old and
mature enough realize her have difficulty blaming her directly
for religious teachings her mother swears but when discussed this with
daughter she made clear she believed buddhism and not
initial response anger was suggest there faith
christ then why does she celebrate suggested
would never force her practice religious beliefs celebrating holidays
with her
not want her from the and would willing allow her
continue practicing buddhism though had choice seeing her only

this seems pretty arogant definition beliefs
are those things which find true based experience the
this experience includes study things that may not have
experienced but even can only understand the

have
which means that beliefs about god are directly related
experience having experienced try make sense
that study religion and read the find things
that echo what have already out this build
also find things that match that
make them they just match maybe
will understand that stuff maybe all
beliefs are can change
someone else has beliefs that are different from
neither are necessarily someone else making sense out
different set even though have different
explanations and talk might even discover that the
underlying experiences are

	would like the opinion netters subject that has been bothering
wife and catholic the last few
years seems that there are more and more hoc events during
driving the most aspect liturgical tradition
that what happens something because all know how
led the which makes kind dialogue
present but the best masses been were participatory
think the proportion participation has and the proportion
sitting there and generally being told what
necessary because one knows happening
last sunday went the local usually
palm the congregation participates reading the taking
the role the the theology behind this seems say
mean did and came back today
always gives but last week were sit
during the gospel and besides the orwellian
was really saddened have little role taken this seems
typical shift participation away from the and toward the
and new things are introduced the course the
liturgy and since one knows the new things have
and pretty soon instead lot the mass just
sitting there listening spacing how the mass about
lay the blame liturgy committees made lay
but that may not think that liturgy committee has
bias toward doing something rather than just fact
bureaucratic though simpler liturgy may fact make easier for
people aware the
been the the quality the mass
going mean that mass every thursday
friday and are reminded the power very simple liturgy make aware
but far the obligatory sunday should
just offer has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation catholic masses

	hello are doing bible study
have been doing pretty good far getting some sort reasonable
are now chapters and which talk about the

views this the falling babylon chapter the same

this imagery the roman catholic church was certainly
common earlier protestant lot find that frankly
embarassing though some our readers will certainly advocate
such the problem that the description makes look
lot like political associated with controls
world seated seven mountains recall that rome
traditionally regarded built seven
then not the current roman catholic but church that has
been taken over the and merged with the turning
into something rather different than presumably such
scenario the true catholics are among those who are given
the overall impression that satan pretending angel
and the true church persecuted think the most
consistent playing out the image would that the
would presiding over church that claims the heir both
the protestant and catholic but that the true spiritual
descendants both peter and the reformers are equally being
	regarding david while not real sure
his remember book called vision
something like made prediction that people who bought gold
would hurt the gold was about
now less than half this prediction stuck mind
because lot people where worked were buying

	was told the bible says that god took the body the virgin mary
was being carried for this were the bible
say
think talking about the the blessed virgin
says that immaculate mother the ever virgin
having completed the course her earthly was assumed
and soul into heavenly this was defined papal
though had certainly been believed some
like the immaculate this primarily
catholic and like has direct biblical
note that catholics not believe
they not believe that the bible the only source
thus the fact that doctrine has little
support not necessarily significant they believe
truth can passed through traditions the and also
can revealed the not interested yet
but any catholics can tell
basis for these think would
again find myself wanting respond posting and having neither
the time nor the proper materials with would think would learn
lesson trying finish writing thesis and have tons
the basis for our catholic belief the assumption
body and into heaven put the apostles
and all the early generation christians believed throughout their
ministry the apostles kept close contact with and the were
present when she only thomas was arrived several days
asked shown her and moved with peter and several
the other apostles brought him her when they arrived the seal was
still they broke the and the body was there
was sign that anyone had forcibly and everything else
was laid out exactly had been the apostles present all believed
that mary was assumed into the apostles taught this their
preaching this does not appear any the texts currently
considered part the but does appear other writings left behind
several apostolic church founded the
believe that the teachings the whether written down
the bible written down other providing that the
authenticity those other sources can least the case
the assumption the authenticity quite

	new this and maybe this has been covered
but does anybody out there see the current emphasis the
environment being turned into
debated this quite and while think legitimate
concern for the planet great can easily see
being perverted into something
may quote the wall street journal all

suspect because one party the
dispute thinks the earth clear that much
the environmentalist energy derived from what has been
called the religious even pagan fanaticism
that now worships such gods nature and gender with
reverence formerly accorded real
	nothing christianity that precludes the idea
repeated lives
there paragraph the new testament which clearly makes
positive inference remember which one off
the top but basically goes like jesus talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can
elijah must first jesus replies that elijah has but they did not
recognize then says that the apostles perceived that was refering
john the this seems clearly imply can anyone
offer reasonable alternative would very interested

analogies can only push argument far both
both and yours assume the premises used set your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will
the important point note the different directions both sides come
christians believe they know the truth and thus believe they have the right
tell the truth
christians can get offended others not believe
the not believe this the truth and get
offended them because they claim know the
this argument goes for not just bagging

after must carry the great family name
was become far more brave and
honoured than his father could ever have though not

saint mother was woman who received immense joy from
praying god and meditating the divine mysteries and the
life our she had little time for the pleasures this
saint began resemble his mother
more than his
saint aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his
but the moment discovered that they were
fainted from this shows his immense hatred sin

about the time his first holy communion received
from the archbishop charles whom himself
became great his purity god and
asked the blessed virgin protect his innocence for

the subject unity between christians and christian
bible study alltough have personal opinion this
thought would nice hear opinions fellow christian
and sisters from different countries and different
member reformed let say little
the only unity found which true when all parties involved are
came out church which even the different
congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was
better and who had the better messages none them put anything
into practice from those since becoming
found that when travel another church the same they
are just accepting there any had retreat back
january when some the congregation from came
retreat was for college and was though had known even
the people from louisville for years had only become disciple
the previous april and had never been the church one
the keys unity unselfish love and that only
one area which disciples stand out from another
part unity common depth also been part
some campus fellowships who were focused unity between
churches and saw that those churches had one thing lack
conviction about everything they that was why they could
they care about the truth but delighted getting along
problem here the netherlands that there are two other churches
with the same both have the same
there are only some differences with respect for
the matter appropriation salvation and how
essence lot people these three churches have
faith and feel that they should become one but that
what need there creeds when the bible stands firmly
here first
can the congregation christ separated walls different
this definitely untolerable situation
according the
according the splits and differences opinion are going
per previous mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely many there are also differences opinion
and scripture
the following directives have praise for for your
meetings more harm than the first hear that when
you come together there divisions among and some
extent believe doubt there have differences among you
show which you have approval corinthians
how will god show his fruitfulness acts but
before there are these
devotion the apostles teaching
fellowship
communion
filling with awe for god
all having everything
glad and sincere hearts
praising god
enjoying the favor the people
all these are mentioned acts god also shows that those who
have these qualities are look man full
faith and the holy who was later stoned
can one say that only one these three churches the
true church jesus
one can say that church the true church only that church
perfect not only the congregation but worldwide
have yet find but the closest one found the boston
church christ which constantly strives have errors
pointed out and also the only one seen which
totally sold out
problem closely related these question
can cooperate with other christians from these two churches
before there this question especially important
for those who think that only one church can the
for that can always the other hand may
never for those who think about only one church being the
remind them that mark states that there are
disciples who are not part the main group begin but they
will not lose their with the boston heard
numerous times this exact same that there are disciples out there
that are not part the boston movement but that does not make them
any less few people admit that ever run
into someone who has the qualities disciple outside the
know
this last problem sounds little strange most
your have lot organizations here which
founded people one specific church and whose members
all members that this has been considered
for only few years ago people started
about this and now are the middle this
organizations are opening their doors for people from
churches
must warn that this sounds cliquey clique group which
runs around together some extent this causes problems
fellowship and causes would not say all that this
something for for any one
the churches for there was internal clique
people who were the different
heads the they rarely talked anyone else outside
the committees and seldom were voted out office without another
office being that they would have step right back
their degree exclusion was such that when the new pastor
nearly had wipe out everything and start from scratch wish
since they still have clue about what means
this rigidity the clique beginning
broken but still must warn against such division
enough division
for your opinions

	thing understand why being sacred should make the
rituals
the attributes being sacred this case that they
should not spoken under
such the lords name the ceremonies are
performed the temple because the temple has been set aside
being believe that the
ceremonies can only interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right which this case the
from our point when they are brought
out into the they are being trampled under
because misinterpretations and and therefore
offensive
please not assume that because use the words
and that official spokesman for the lds
merely stating what believe the general
feeling among others feel free

from god and put which exactly the doctrine augustine

they suffer the lightest the loss the vision oand

and wait see any dents any armor and faith
wavered since the day became you may want try
	coming from long line know temper when see
one the tell tale that give away
when their net replies are angry and
the net village have laugh two when born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
instead answering questions with sweetness and
these chrisitan the
you need any you already yourselves the greatest
again
	and the same goes for other cultural the festival
easter may possibly have some historical association with
some pagan but there far
christians who honor any kind
celebrating
that argument would more compelling were not for the
ishtar eggs and ishtar why mix pagan fertility symbols from the
worship the pagan goddess fertility with biblical what
would really lost all you were just drop the word and
replace all such occurances with would you not
show for services they were called sunday
rather than
	just thought share some words that received letter
from moody bible institute couple months the words are
james the president
other was the dry cleaner and the radio was
caught attention because talk show guest was criticizing evangelical
saying believe absolutes and think are the only ones
who know what the absolutes
missed the
stowell missed the
affirm the absolutes not because are arrogant
but because believe god who who has revealed his
truth his and therefore hold precious the strategic importance
those
stowell seems have jumped rather strangely from truth
see how that necessarily
are all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer either these questions then perhaps you can
explain how you determine which parts scripture are and
which truths are who qualified make these
there hardly even evangelical
christianity mention the rest regarding
biblical
find statement terribly
carol alvin
	and write lots and lots about absolute truth and
strongly suspect that are reaching impasse which why
deign from commenting much
agree that probably never and starting feel
and tired having conversations with husband
dominated this topic
have that participating this discussion has been
good learning experience for views this topic have evolved
and clarified through and suspect that may not disagree
much
admit that strongly prejudiced against evangelical
and may not always rational reactions grew
and went was definitely the wrong place
for and react strongly any implication that conservative
christianity has any sort stronghold true shudder
when remember the condescending attitude had about other christians
who adhere the
have come see that real objection this whole notion
absolute truth the actions have seen lead have had some
very bad experiences with evangelical christians claiming know the
and judging others based their belief that they have
the knowing the truth seem leave whole lot
room for
can accept your belief absolute truth long try
use that belief try force others comply with and you are
very careful that you hurt others with love your neighbor
seems totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes
that everyone should living that other people have
convictions about the truth every bit strong and sincere
based careful and their relationship with
dismiss them because god lead them the same conclusions
not directed personally
carol alvin
	would like see christians devote bit less effort
paganism and more figuring out how present the gospel
christ the the pagans have lot the right
unlike who deny the need for any

infallibility does not say that the pope always all
catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been number
occasions when the pope was there appear two aspects
one general concept that the long run the
church protected from serious however this does not mean
that impossible for take wrong turns one time
the more specific concept papal infallibility that
very specific circumstances papal statement can known
however relatively small fraction statements meet
those this does not absolve catholics from the duty obey
even teachings the however only few teachings
are made way that explicitly

	here some material michael davies the subject schism
general and archishop lefebvre wrote around
the first part the article was the scandalous
activities archbishop weakland this but cut all
and pared down the rest what was
joe buehler
schism and disobedience
according thomas schism consists primarily
refusal submission the pope communion with the members the
church united first sight would appear whatever
the subjective motivation the discussed
must state objective schism has refused submit
the pope very grave matter involving his supreme power
standard catholic textbooks theology make
clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts
disobedience are this were was noted the
beginning this would mean that the number american
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double
the distinction between disobedience and schism made very clear
the article schism the very authoritative dictionnaire
theologie the article father yves congar who
certainly friend archbishop explains that schism
and disobedience are similar that they are often father
congar writes that schism involves refusal accept the existence
legitimate authority the for rejection
the father congar explains that the refusal accept
decision legitimate authority particular instance does not
constitute schism but the catholic encyclopedia
explains that for catholic truly schismatic would have
intend sever himself from the church far him
adds that every disobedience order possess this
character must include besides the transgression the command
the denial their divine right only
does lefebvre not deny the divine right the pope
but affirms repeatedly his recognition the authority and
his intention never breaking away from the archbishop made
his attitude clear the issue pray
for the pope every nothing has changed with the consecrations
last june are not recognize john paul
the legitimate pope the catholic even say that
heretical only say that his modernist actions favor
intrinsically
the principal argument used those claiming that lefebvre
schism that the consecration bishop without papal mandate
intrinsically schismatic bishop who carries out such
becomes ipso facto this
not such consecration intrinsically schismatic act
would always have involved the penalty the
code canon law the offence was punished only suspension
canon the pope pius xii had raised the penalty
excommunication response the establishment schismatic
church the consecration these illicit chinese bishops
differed radically from the consecrations carried out lefebvre
the professed intention was repudiate the authority the
that deny that has the right govern the and the
illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given mandate exercise
apostolic neither archbishop lefebvre nor any the
bishops has consecrated claim that they have powers
they have been consecrated solely for the purpose
ensuring the survival the society carrying out ordinations and
also perform not wish minimize any way
the gravity the step take the consecration
bishops without papal mandate far more serious matter than the
ordination priests involves refusal practice the
primacy jurisdiction belonging divine right the roman
but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the
church could not more and that grave measures were needed
appears taken for granted most the critics
that was excommunicated for the offense and the vatican
has certainly been guilty fostering this there not
much modicum truth this the new code
canon law includes section beginning with canon entitled
for specific poenis singula the
first part deals with against religion and the unity the
delictis contra religionem ecclesiae canon
deals with the offense schism which together
with apostasy and one the three fundamental offenses
against the unity the
but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms this
canon under any canon involving offense against
religion the unity the the canon cited his
excommunication comes from the third section for
specific which entitled ecclesial
functions and offenses their munerum ecclesiasticorum
usurpatione degue delictis iniis the canon question
canon which bishop who consecrates someone bishop and
the person who receives such consecration from bishop without
pontifical mandate incur automatic
excommunication reserved the holy
the scandalous attempts smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense
schism contrary both truth and comparable
smear under civil opposed ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive accurate
parallel would state that man convicted manslaughter had
been convicted first degree
must stress that what have written here not the dubious opinion
laymen unversed the intricacies canon canon lawyers
without the least shred sympathy for lefebvre have repudiated
the charge schism made against him totally father
patrick dean the faculty canon law the institut
catholique paris noted the july issue valeurs
actuelles have just lefebvre was not
excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation ecclesiastical
added that not the consecration bishop which
constitutes schism but the conferral apostolic mission upon the
illicitly consecrated this usurpation the powers
the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention establishing
parallel
cardinal rosalio president the pontifical commission for the
authentic interpretation canon commented the consecrations
the july issue would hard
imagine more authoritative the cardinal
the act consecrating bishop papal not
itself schismatic the code that deals with
offenses divided into two one deals with offenses
against religion and the unity the and these are
and consecrating bishop with
pontifical mandate the offense against the
exercise specific for the case the
consecrations carried out the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh
thuc and although the archbishop was excommunicated
was not considered have committed schismatic act because
there was intention breach with the
not simply unjust but ludicrous suggest that consecrating
bishops without papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least
intent establishing schismatic not schismatic and
will never the archbishop considers correctly that
the the church undergoing its worst crisis since the arian
and that for the good the church was necessary for him
consecrate the four bishops ensure the future his canon
law provides for just such and even one believes that
the future the society could have been guaranteed without these
the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that
could not canon law states that has not incurred
while the vatican allows such prelates
archbishop weakland undermine the faith with impunity cannot
expect catholics pay the least attention its sanctions against
great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted
the service the church and the salvation
eric president the international una voce
one the best informed laymen the and
knows the archbishop like has
greater desire than see reconciliation between lefebvre and
the holy see during the quotation from
statement saventhem which was published the february
remnant merits careful
the road leading the consecrations june
appears more paved with grave roman also
omissions than with lefebvrist and from the
eyes informed public this cannot hidden attempting
present the act grave disobedience offense
against the lefebvre has
erroneous concept this were cardinal
ratzinger could behalf the have addressed the
archbishop the following words his letter july
ardent desire safeguard tradition procuring for
means live and testifies your attachment
the faith all the holy father understands your concern
and shares
	dead and useless faith which has action behind actions
prove our faith and show the genuineness
good example this abraham the james hebrews
says that abraham was justified faith but his faith was demonstrated
through his works obeyed what god told him
reading genesis very was man
beset faith lot the time lying about sarah being his
wife trying fulfil promise behalf
copulating with yet seems that god evaluate him the

this gives although real faith demonstrates itself through
god not going judge according our

saved through the washing and renewing the holy
amazing
	like refusing kingdom
one revelation this thing
the old people refuse believe even when
was alive here they refuse what more when just
talking through somebody
with all the knowledge believers would think that
would enough detect which ones are
and opposed
these these are you afraid that they are not from
that these are the signs should not open our hearts and mind for thinking
they are
faith god
true peace true love that divine and pure
why someone accept that god can what wants fulfillment his
generous love and never ending forgiveness those who turn back
him for
why are refusing messenger this the mother all who are
what brings
fears being shamed what others will think say about
could pleasing
fears being
fears being judged wrong mainstream standard what
why tolerate mockery ridicule for the
sake love and obedience the humbling lessons left
martyrs and
rather engage bickering and disproof each
opinion looking each mistakes for the sake
instead having communion one body with
what makes blind the truth that god all powerful and that can
not binded what people wrote and have written about him all
why our faith god all the words and literature
what prevents from going being saved and extend rich love
others who are
why are our eyes not wide open see that continuously sees our hope
and love which glorify him and gives indications his
acknowledgements with divinely
that like view that all these
are just ordinary here earth and not caused anything
why then does the holy mother comes back remind
must really that changes the course things and that
with prayers wars can
but then she
often have egotistic dear these days you
have prayed very your hands have remained
why hesitate proclaiming what needs
the holy living life
what the gospel
why not the
the mother
your good live the
why worry going good use
our holy mother
them the not worry about anything
anyone but entrust yourself the
although the holy mother does not insist
are bow before the freedom which god gives
but she follows this
are surprised because say decide for god and see how
you have lived this
why does she constantly
this life toward god the way the lord himself

what indicates that you may believe
not believe predestination believe all
whether not will accept gift salvation
fundamental difference which really
course believe very biblical doctrine
romans shows other the church
has always taught from the very but say
that believe predestination does not mean not believe free
men freely choose the course their which also
affected the grace unlike the calvinists and
hold that grace otherwise you end with
the idiocy denying the universal saving will god timothy
for god must give enough grace all but only the
who are predestined and receive the grace final
which guarantees this does not mean that those
without that grace just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not give knowing they would not need
they had freely chosen
people who are saved are saved the grace and not their own
for was god who disposed them and predestined
them become but those who perish everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose they were
deserving they had rejected their and
sinned against the working the holy
god but will only mete out that
the last
would hold that god most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done was only
for those bless the next blesses this and
those will not punish the next will chastised this one
purgatory for their every sin incurs some temporal
god will punish unless satisfaction made for
samuel sin adultery and murder were
but was still punished with the death his and
need not point out the idea punishment because judgement
quite prevelant the sodom and moses barred from
the holy the slaughter the annias and
jerusalem
jesus stopped the stoning adulterous woman this
not but going with why should
not the murder and violation people who may may more
should stop the slaughter the innocent proverbs but
does that mean that christians should support war bosnia with the
even the not think but
and disagree with foreign adventures but
the case frankly see excuse for getting militarily
would not after the
was what our lord not the our
actions bosnia must for and not for war which

	this being posted general outline for your personal study this
the doctrine god
the persons the godhead
all the doctrines this the most
the bible revelation
our first objective studying the bible should
know
believe that the bible teaches that there are three
persons the godhead the god the
lord jesus and the holy
believe that they are individual persons who are one

possessing the same divine they are also
equally worthy our our and our

knowing all end from the
infinitely omnipotent with
unlimited power over all
god infinite his and
conviction that the work the lord our day
has become very and that the people our
churches know very little about believe that the
work needs and that the
people god need understand that god sovereign

	all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer either these questions then perhaps you can
how you determine which parts scripture are and
truths are
the answer both questions
have different definitions absolute
absolute something that constant across
true every instance you agree
this think you
all truth truth
contradiction when something when always
not always then have
contradiction
agree with your use the term
rather
simple
the new testament have bible and
women are instructed silent and cover
heads this your
truth and therefore
hold said that all scripture discerning
exactly what paul and company were trying say not always
believe that paul was trying say that all women should
behave that was trying say that under the circumstances
the the women was speaking would best avoid volubility and
cover their this has with maintaining proper witness toward
remember that any number relativistic statements can derived
from for absolutely right for christians
strive for this does not rule out trying maintain world
peace resorting violence
are clearly not taking this particular part scripture
absolute there are plenty other
you reconcile
the bible preaches absolute exactly what those
truths are sometimes matter the bible does
preach absolute sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear least sometimes they are not clear
everyone should baptism full immersion that
largely because not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
are speaking particular culture christianity this
where scholarship and the study biblical contexts comes
very difficult see how you can claim something which based
your own
god revealed his truths the through his utterly
that some people whill come with alternate
practically anything can especially

	ofm responds query about reference
from you might also want consider
these are books intended for use undergraduate bible
they give historical discussion literary
and generally they have good bibligraphies for further
typically recommend froehlich and
two other intros
the translation strandard
the references are slightly dated and the style somewhat but
the book contains wealth
perrin and intro also very somewhat more
modern than but not quite densely also the
authors tend through the books the the historical order
this gives very useful perspective the
development the
there are also some good probably the
best recommendation these days would bible
slight think the but not one
particular problem have that tends pretty skimpy
bibliographic feeling that for quick
but not real useful for study depth keep copy
office
think there may couple books with this
far know there the only one book with this exact title
general harper and although think
recall series under the name also
separate bible dictionary comments
the also apply the
favorite commentary the jerome biblical
the njbc rather catholic focus and somewhat biased
towards the reader can decide for himself whether
these are pluses any case the scholarship and
large
the njbc completely updated version the
biblical copies which can still found
nichael
	can only reply with what says timothy
not here discount parts the
here only discount the notion
the author timothy told what thought was the
based his belief his faith jesus
the resurrected and his readings the old
but what had been revealed him
was based given
friends and authors who may not have given the
whole truth who may have exaggerated
first the original poster the reference from tim
the author was and his revelations were anything but
came about that was approaching
and suddenly light from heaven flashed around and
fell the and heard voice saying
why are you persecuting and art and
jesus whom you are
paul received revelation directly from the risen
became closely involved with the early the leaders which were
followers jesus throughout his ministry
you may holy spirit revealed these things
unto and could into that but
convince that the holy
spirit
believe anyone but the spirit would able convince you
the spirit please complain about this being know
but can anything the natural world explain the
why revelation necessary the authors the
what has written
again info were given the
and still carries the chance not
the spirit part how much closer the source can you
the greek timothy which sometimes translated
literally means other god spoke the actual words
into the many theologians and bible scholars james boice
one that can remember get quite annoyed the dryness and
incompleteness
only way you would able escape this notion
info have had the entire bible
written god and tell the
studied the bible and have yet
hear scholars who have put forth objective evidence
showing god the first author this collection
what the verse taken from timothy was all the continuity
book written over span years more than authors from all walks
life testimony the single authorship
and for read what says corinthians about
human basically says that human wisdom useless when
compared with what god has written for our
you knew jesus well you know the
realize reasoned out the law and the prophets for
the common
what source you claim have discovered which has information superior
historicity the certainly not the writings
the gnostics which were third the
and though some claim jesus was
was with all the human wisdom the
apostle paul set out would you not
embrace the idea that jesus was
jesus was fully god why assert that
realise that you may not accept the authority the this
unfortunate say the because there other way learning
about god and christ and purpose with the earth than reading the
bible and searching out its truth for
your was raised without any knowledge
the time some the faithful came show
the word and share with its was living
happily and morally without acknowledging the existence
supreme read the bible
several times over its entirety and have studied
contains truth and consider
jesus one the most moral human beings
have lived idolize the but
rational reason for except
please rethink this last there which seems your
current then jesus was either liar complete nut because not
only did assert that god but claimed god
how then could you have the least bit respect for
careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
gut feelings about the text and other unsubstantiated
the bible pleads that take its entirety throw the whole book
about your reading the not only does the spirit inspire the
but guides the reader cannot understand the
least without the
god revealed them through the for the spirit
searches all even the depths cor
peace and may god guide
carter page happiness the crown and chiefest part
apprentice and hold god this the law
learn when are from sophocles
theologians get quite annoyed the misleadingess
true that the greek word has its roots
and however etymology necessarily tell you what
word would religious expression
comes from with you have look how the
word was actually this case the word used for wisdom
dreams that come from but
	just finished study not only looking the
prophecies but where they were while going only
through the found after starting show their
found out that had missed needless say
cannot post them the study did intend publish
the process organizing and showing the then
will ready write and send with any luck
free should have finally done sometime around

	just quick
the way you are interpreting those passages your you make
sound your opinion somehow undisputable
many would interpret the passages you cite very
the great theologians you mentioned that
very these were people who had much more expertise the
interpretation scripture than you probably anyone reading
this say that all them are wrong and you are right
those last three coming pretty darn
close the sin
the future would suggest you not absolutist your

when comes how the catholic law for interfaith weddings
but pretty sure that can get married without too much the
trick lies the letter

for yet another
	question that some friends and were debating last
you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
unbelievers simply remained would you remain
pertinent believing xians deleted for
strikes for apparent that this
had proof that there existed which would
eternally punished for not believing would that make
being merely reversal your this
add anything the
several friends arguing the fear hell was necessary
motivate people that fatally undercuts the
message that god
point very well

just quick mary was immaculately she
could pure does this mean that she was without sin
the perfect female human
this why she held highly the catholic church despite
basically patriarchical
she was immaculately and never subject original
but also never committed personal sin her whole this was
possible because the special degree grace granted her
she regarded highly because her special relationship
and everything that flows from that
the catholic church sees her the new fathers the
early church use this particular figure
eve the mother all the living genetic mary the
mother all the living the order sin came through
grace jesus christ came through
	like those
whenever approached
fundamentalists who throw the bible because
have long wear black leather and listen black
have something throw
just goes show that there are more important evils the
battle than rock
just goes show that not all evangelical fundamentalists are
wear black leather like classic but longer have the long
locks once too rely upon the bible basis for christian
fundamentalistic
	the last sentence since many readers
seem not embarrassed apologists such
josh mcdowell and the above also expresses rather odd sense
what makes you think the masses who were
mostly knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
cream the could read and everyone
the medieval period the was matter uncritically
accepting what they were
bill mayne

him the and quoted many
this logical its original
was
lewis has taken couple pretty severe hits this group
first somebody was accusing him being and
now are told that christians should embarrassed well
josh about whom have having never read his
anyone who thinks that lewis was ought read his
introduction the problem which his
explains that wanted publish the book although
believed the argument was did not want seem
presume tell others how brave they should the face their own
did not want people think that was presenting himself
some kind model that was anything other than what
considered himself great
ofm has adequately handled the question whether ought
embarrassed argument the
part bigger would just like add far from
being embarrassed state continual amazement the
soundness and clarity the arguments

got some verses which are not subject interpretation because they say
what they they are peter timothy and

john then words are true and not need

	posted this couple weeks and seem have appeared
the and had reply from the were
having intermittent problems with our mail the please excuse
you have seen this
should christians
last week alastair posted some questions about and whether there
are such things have started looking into these
things and have jotted down findings answered all
his questions and know what have here slightly different
but possibly able get into more deeply and post
some more info
our duty our
good all men
love our neighbour ourselves
act the part the good samaritan toward any who may
will therefore render every possible assistance injured
and therefore should not part any organisation which causes
people harm medical corps the army
christians are faith the commonwealth
and also recognise that rules the kingdoms
and therefore should not taking part any the struggles
those nations which are not part due our
are and amongst the are just
passing and not part any nation any national aspirations
can also applied politics but another
are not supposed yourselves
therefore incosistent for strive assist
preserving state which christ will destroy when returns set
our duty the
therefore unto caesar the things which and unto god
the things which
every soul subject unto the higher for there power
but the powers that are ordained whosoever resisteth
the resisteth the ordinance
yourselves every ordinance man for the whether
king for the will god that with well doing
may put silence the ignorance foolish pet
these scriptures make clear that submission the powers that
divine but equally clear from acts that when any
ordinance man runs counter must refuse submission
the reason for this that are and his
service our example the type thing col
where bondservants were heartily unto the
also should work our boss was god shaken
and running oops bit side track
the contests between the are side side that
not fighting the but the
when believe god and embrace his become
citizens with the saints and the household and are longer
interested associations the think this relation
unions etc paul tells aside every that may
run race that set before and are will discard
any association which would retard our progress therefore endure
hardness good soldier jesus man that warreth entangleth
himself with the affairs this that may please him who hath
chosen him tim
one these entanglements warns about not unequally yoked
together with one the obvious applications this
marriage with but also covers things like business
partnerships and any other position where may form close association
with any person persons not believing the truth about god this case
the the principle comes from deut remember that well
them being different animals different one was clean and one
unclean under the these ideas are strongly stressed cor
suggest you read the yoking also has another aspect that
and jesus says yoke upon are then yoked
with christ and cannot yoked with have already seen
that are bondservants and paul says not the
bondservants men cor
example from the old the question asked chr
thou help the the situation here good
example what happens when you are yoked together with
jehoshaphat was lucky escape with his here are the
had made affinity with who had himself work
wickedness before the kings
when asked ahab form military had agreed and said
thou people thy kings unequal
sttod firm refusing the advice the false prophets and insisted
hearing the prophet the lord the right
found that was yoked and therefore break away from the evil
association had
god says out from among them and and touch not
the unclean and will receive you and shall sons and
cor
this more less what have found out far still looking into
think answered all the questions raised alastair
heres summary and few things think
the christian under obedience this command essential
factor his relationship with christ
total dedication this course action required
disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his
followers pet
are separated god this involves
relationship
man can serve two masters
all that the lust and pride quite opposed gos
john christs kingdom not this world not worldly
his servants would fight deliver christ
our master and was not delivered his servants because his kingdom
was not this then his servants cannot possibly fight for another
strangers and pilgrims have and cannot swear allegiance
anyone but
the servant the lord must not war but gentle all tim
this does not just apply but also avoiding strife throughout
our there war not with weapons cor
but with armour
probably post some more when had time look into things bit

let state point provocatively
after going through several study leaning heavily towards
assertion that wisdom ben
directly referenced think
sirach more directly referenced james than
referenced any verse
good the new testament does not quote
song just does not quote
from the but the the former does not
disqualify neither does the the and the
wisodm solomon was quite clearly influence especially
the letter the romans especially romans and wisdom
think everyone would agree that principles that cannot
applied are not very useful
are exclude them accord them the authority
would appear require other what might these
reasons tradition with tradition
this vaticanus sinaiticus
know listed the muratorian canon
oldest list know sirach the are discussed
the but not
not all accepted them though niether were all the
books the new testament which puts the lie the whole
argument the books being excluded because they were debated and not
universally the and
others were debated various but eventually for
the codexes you both vaticanus and sinaitcus include the
bothe the new and old and vaticanus
inlcudes the shepard and the epistle
for the muratorian deals with the new testament
though very valuable its witness those
interim conclusion that protestant exclusion
least one these writings one those
one hears they were excluded during the
and that appears the reason many people
continue exclude
can all else fails
where
not exlcude
will explain
nothing read the church under the nmae divine
except the canonical and the canoncial scriptures are
four books kingdoms samuel and two books
paralpomenon the psalter the five
books solomon song wisdom
and the wisdom jesus son
the books the twelve jeremiah

this same list was promulgated again the third council carthage
and the sixth council carthage which
council the same list was enumerated with the words have
recieved from the fathers that these are the books read the
which ought quiet those who assert the name holy
scripture understand those books whose authority there was
never any doubt the the episcopal church does removing
the deuterocanon from the realm the episcopalians
hold them high regard and read them the they are not
counted scripture and may not used prove the
lutherans hold out
earlier mention the apocrypha divine scripture can also
and below inlcude only portion the quotes calling
divine scripture that could found among the writings the
this the reason why the law the old testament reckoned
consisting that they may correspond the
number letters the hebrew noted also
that adding these tobias and there are
corresponding the number letters used the

should disqulaify the old testament and must point out that
the jews only drew their canon years after the founding
the christian religion upon the why should adhere
canon that was drawn the reaction the chrsitian

justin had already accused the jews mutilating the

preceding comment supposed
note that have participated for over
five years say siemon was not too far
the meat his boundary serves excellent example what
meant way out the wrote that human brains
infested with and can trusted only limited
boundary
would beg differ with you the conscience
can trusted virtually all the
which just moves the problem back one how you tell your
conscience properly
the only way tell presuppose that you are capable judging the
your own other you can only sure
that your conscience you assume that your evaluation
can assuming your conclusions saves you lot
but not valid way
unless you are your judgements about your own thinking cannot
not possible certain your conscience
that supposed
boundary then gives another paradigm example the
now you have hit the purpose the necessity the
infallible interpreter divine without the
christianity would nothing more than bunch little divisive
the church the infallible interpreter divine
how you you believe this because some argument
another how you know that the argument contains
you
although our minds are finite and susceptible our
competence arriving inductive insights gives confidence our
ability distinguish what true from what not even areas
not subject the experimental
but there huge difference between our ability
distinguish what true from what not and
confident about lot but absolute certainty very long way
from
this discussion about the arrogance claiming absolutely certain
check the subject saying you are absolutely certain
significantly different than saying you are when you say that
you are that invites people ask
except very limited when you say that you are absolutely
invites people dismiss you someone who does not have any
idea his own
have yet meet anyone who believed source
truth who would admit the possibility errors his all
them every last one has claimed that was himself
the result has been convince that they had idea what was going
particular discussion may not entirely relevant the
original get the feeling that the original poster
regarded arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong
answers and that the difference can have eternal
when say that think there hell and that
least significant danger ending will admit that
you say the reasoning processes used reach this are
thus least principle could but these
basic facts are clearly enough taught the bible that think
unlikely that misinterpreting order get this level
tried frame statement sufficiently carefully
sidestep number the more controversial for
example said that all will definitely end
and attempted describe hell any have
feeling that view going regarded arrogant and
intolerant even though acknowledge that fallible and
some chance
get wrong think there are lot genuinely arrogant
and often criticism but least
some cases think the criticisms constitute blaming the
the universe set that there are eternal consequences for
certain not fault just telling the way
think you may think god immoral for setting things that
one the critiques christianity that find most
difficult respond but not arrogance for tell what
think the
	question that some friends and were debating last
you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
unbelievers simply remained would you remain
contention that you answer this question with would
not then remain then you really are not one
following jesus christ has everything with sharing

technology admire the the and
strike after the war concluded began really enjoy
simulations based around this conflict great and bomb

the simulation the death people was wonderful
imagine the real pilots view the real thing much the same
one only has look the language used see that the personal impact
war building containing aircraft flown
pilot simply dead civilians are these
euphanisms are way removing the reality war from the people whose
support are necessary for the continued waging war one only has
look vietnam see how important public opinion
now see troops sponsored the united nations entering and
the prospect military intervention the conflict
the former revulsion particular the siege
and the last few days
has caused rethink where stand

important realize that all actions have
that were made for our own but suggest that
for certain types sin think
things much too
sin can have terrible but need
when saying that the consequences are for
wish that you had followed this thread before jumping
seen anybody write that aids was for certain
types sin includes mark ashley who you were responding
myself wrote that when you things way that
curses will come you and although one definition
only meant when used the
because god loves has told the best way live his
god cause warns
kevin davis wrote while
week was guilty and whole mess
yet forgiven and not condemned suffer with
even suggest that aids
the bible makes clear that all equally deserve death
much worse than have all hurt god with our
paul conditt reveals his
case you get angry and upset when
see things like instead rationalizing our own fears and
need reaching out people with aids and other
unacceptable whether they got the disease through
own actions not they still need
the first issue you bring your wrong
angry for any especially angry
which par with jesus has every reason angry
for putting him the cross with our yet his prayer was
them they know not what they knowing how forgiving jesus
has been with calls more forgiving with everyone out
love for please give will only cause
foolish quarrels and more bad
okay you read something that bothers but you need
address loving right felt like someone out
there was saying that god punishes gay sexually immoral people with
aids because they deserve punishment that others then would
frame response something like
makes feel very sad for someone believe that which
simply harmful disease not unlike any punishment
for people who have committed certain god loves all his
children equally and rejoices when single one comes back
will all judged after but until then all have the
opportunity accept grace earnestly seeking after him with
all our believing the repenting our
confessing that jesus lord and living new life
for
let not judge someone eternally arm not
short will anything can move hardened heart
misled works for the good all even through
the worst has set the times and places for all men
that they may perhaps reach out and find
the second issue you bring seeing people rationalize their fears
people with what you describe seeing
actually you have been missing the points made the
earlier posts and reacting anger attitudes that been
know that its sometimes hard discount your
but please try
you are quite correct saying that should reach out all people
because they all need this what brothers and sisters and
daily you would like send the name the
city and state you live will find and get you touch with some
brothers who have aids know people with aids and live nearby you
that you can see the loving attitudes for
the third issue you bring the importance how some individual
contracted how someone gets aids only relevant their
salvation that there may repetence
the important point that not listening
commands advice causes harm
misfortune yourself and for this good way
prevent the misfortune which can transmitted sinful
listen advice and have sex only with your wife

answer did the universe emerge from
science has some good candidates for
all which require something christians readily admit
the fact that there are several candidates belies that are
with out conclusive are left with
could even argued that one these hypotheses may one day proven
best event can but what holds
someone the belief that any all them are except
couple paragraphs ask does the
universe
think this question should actually split into two namely
why there why anything
and
how did the universe emerge from
clear science has nothing say about the first
meaningful after
would say consider the
apparently for many
the question anything can countered
demanding answer question there nothing
both questions turn out
devoid things that exist and things that exist
tautology its
carefully examine the original and then the
the first asks while the second request for
address why something does does not but asks define
the lack the second question unanswerable for
how identify something they mutually exclusive
how identify state this
nearing the limits this simple ability and
would appreciate
might the worldview that exist and things that
grounded the realm the
does the belief based the assumption
that there reason for something ultimately
the position there being its very
foundation exists the same soil that one who claims there
come either therefore for
the former satisfactory then you are for you are
and need not the your search just
seriously doubt god could have answer this
time will
some christians have talked have said that god
himself the see several problems with this
inevitably leads the conclusion that god
actually good and devils and and
this not
would lead question their definition christianity
another answer that god the all
this sounds much but tempted does god
himself god the source his own
can only mean that terms human always
but this not the same the source all
this does not preclude his only seeks identify his
exists
the best answer have heard that human reasoning incapable
understanding such being atheist not
accept such since not have any other
like the come statement for this position assumes
that the evidence hand not arguing against
scientific for science useful for understanding the universe
which but differ from the atheist matter
seek understand what exists understand and appreciate the art the
also have discovered science inadequate tool answer
appears that pihko agrees shall but because tool
inadequate answer question does not preclude the asserting
that invalid question does not provide
far can the very laws nature demand that
true something outside nature
this not science collection models telling
not something cannot see any good reason why the
questions would bound only natural assuming that the
supernatural domain supernatural beings
appropriate ask why they ask why
was using why did this come why did
become why did become
but come the admission that science fails answer because
answered the realm modern does that make the
question

technology would able produce that necessary despite
having all the parts just
this opinion also called that living systems are
somehow different from inanimate christians
general adopt this what would happen when scientists announce
they have created primitive life small
suppose would the same thing when galileo capernicus was
someone starts jumping and down screaming
note said certainly hope gotten
beyond the the

	dean velasco quoted letter from james president
moody bible
the other was the dry cleaner and the radio was
caught attention because talk show guest was criticizing
evangelical saying believe absolutes and think
are the only ones who know what the absolutes
affirm the absolutes not because are arrogant
but because believe god who who has revealed
his truth his and therefore hold precious the strategic
importance those
there has been lot but far nobody seems have hit
exactly what the criticism aimed
the arrogance being attacked that are the only ones who know
what the absolutes many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible the matter religious
the problem one you can
think epistemology you that turns
very troubling
the problem with the least some
the thinking goes inside your own unless you can certain that
everything which happens your head the reasoning you did
discover source truth
and that means you not have absolute justification for your source
authority which means you not have absolute
take the specific example biblical and fictional
inerrantist named following arguments applies the idea
papal
zeke spent some time studying the and and
several other has based all these studies
possibly some religious that the bible source absolute
may but even cannot certain that
his conclusion depends how well studied history may have made
and the references used may have contained his
conclusion depends how well studied the bible may have made
his conclusion depends his own reasoning and may have made
common thread
everything about his study the world that did everything that
happened his own head limited his own matter what
does try and cover his can never certain his own
long any part the belief based his own
that belief cannot considered
zeke believes that has found source absolute truth but that belief
only good the quality the search made for unless can
say that his own reasoning his conclusions are
any belief that you hold about absolute sources truth depends part
your own thinking there way out the only infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty all his
this easy back our shorthand method doing
you imagine hypothetical
the bible source absolute
how you
studied history and the bible and religious writings and church
teachings and came this
how you know you studied history
how you know you
compared answers with some smart people and
just because some smart guy believes something that mean
how you know they studied
you will eventually get the point where has say
prove that there are and long you may have made
then you cannot absolutely
there way out the
this where the many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are
and that there possibility
claiming that you cannot have made and that your thinking has led
you flawless pretty
people who want see this argument explained great detail should try

the idea that the pope can knowably infallible does very

was that the body was stolen

that jews believed the body had been there were really
they could not have effectively made this they

how does one tell second coming the real unless the
person claiming obviously
not saying that david koresh the second coming how could
somebody who breaks his word the second koresh did promise that
would come out his compound only was allowed give radio
still seems that did fool some
from meagre knowledge the seems that christians have
been hard the jews day for being cautious about accepting
somebody that their religious authorities accept the
was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty wanting
early recognize the second coming the same not wanting
credulously believing just anybody who claims
and then any one says here the
there not believe
mark false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and
lead the
mark but take have told you all things
mark those after that the sun will
and the moon will not give its
mark and the stars will falling from and the powers
the heavens will
mark and then they will see the son man coming clouds with
great power and
understanding answer unlike his first
which was the second coming will quite
telling not misled the other things that have happen
before his second coming the actual second coming will make his
power openly
the from public statement not clear
that claiming
	basic problem with your argument your total and complete reliance
biblical account highly suspect would refer you
hermeneia commentary
even there was independent proof that account was
find strange that you would take the negation
truth without any direct historical evidence least that
back the assertion was unequivocally
that christian ever sufferred for their faith believing
the account suggests and the
absence direct eyewitnesses who can claim that luke
then suggest that this unequivocal assertion
the problem here that you have taken one peice without
bothering connect with the other have repeatedly noted that
one needs take the problematic historcity acts and then examine the
work john dominic crossan and burton once you have taken the time
examine recent developments biblical think you will
grasp more clearly what
think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than
was answer the claim that the witnesses
lying because they were willign suffer for their
thus not necessary show that christian ever suffered
for believing the rather the issue whether
those who witnessed
agree that the posting responding shows that there
can liberal well conservative
certainly this issue think the situation waco shows most
all that required that people are willing die for
belief for then surely david koresh the son
the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had true for people
willing die must put the other problem that
even the resurrection was big deal
seem have been for either even john certain
there are lot other things which the early christians could have been
doing together that would have been worth dying belief that
even the idea mixed race which brought down
boundaries the name koinonia could have been enough for people
willing radical communties that
but original point was that roman persecution the only persecution
have documented proof was not about whether carpenter came back from
the such claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent the roman
greek point that avoidance military and civic duty
emperor would have been much more problematic which has nothing
with the resurrection when nero used christians human
torches light his dinner party because the believe
risen was because they were supposedly involved incest and
the argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection
just cannot stand critical

idea resurrection one which can found host different

know why gave you that murillo want
but god does still speak his people and the idea contrary the
idea closed ireneaus wrote about all the gifts the spirit

put forth new testament which was almost identical the one
have believed closed
many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded the
for one prophet whose name starts with who
prophecied that the king would lose that the only prophecy
gave recorded and that had given other prophecies
because the king complained before heard the never prophesies
anything good about yet only one little paragraph all his
lifetime prophecies are recorded there are numerous
barnabas was acts before was even sent out
yet his writings are not recorded only two
agabus prophecies are mentioned was already prophet

prophecy may genuine and from but that does not make
interesting note that some called prophecies are nothing new
rather inspired translation right call
that more having with

prophecies that give applications for there are also
similar examples the several times peter interprets prophecies
seemingly prophetic for his bishoprick let another
concerning judas
clearer example can found matthew jesus prophesying about
what will happen before his return and quotes passage out joel
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning scriptural
prophecy can used later

ignored christians seen any stonings time
max muir
list was posted not long aside from commonly
cited passages
the story note however that this was homosexual and
disagreement that that take intermediate
position note that sodom referred elsewhere the
bible for its seem have been known
specifically for think was considered
cesspool all however from what know jewish
homosexuality would have contributed the horror the action
almost seems have been contrived combine about
many forms evil one act homosexual rape
who were actually but this story not specifically
about
the the clear references are all from rom
there passage that presupposes that homosexuality
note that the passage about homosexuality about
homosexuality visited people
least there are number arguments over this
does not use the word and referring
people who are nature heterosexual practicing
not what call explicit teaching against all
but does seem support what would natural assumption
that paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards
the other passages occur lists cor and tim
unfortunately not entirely clear what the words used here
there have been suggestions that one has broader
such and that another may specifically
have here precise teaching about
but least weak supportive evidence that paul
shared the negative judgement
jude sometimes however probably not the
context jude involves since those who were almost raped
sodom were seems likely that refers
intercourse with
you can the evidence such that conclusion
determined their approach the conservatives note that
the passages from letters imply that accepted the
this enough for them regard having
liberals note that specific and
clear definition what being prohibited why the concern
rom the connection homosexuality pagan what exactly
the words the lists sins thus some believe
legitimate regard this attitude paul took with him from his
background and not specific teaching the
this explosive which tends result long
dissertations the exact meaning various greek but
clear that mostly what really comes down
whether people are looking the bible for law whether they
believe that such approach inconsistent with the this
appears depend upon reaction the message the bible
well perception the needs the church
this difference approach least serious the difference
between protestant and catholic the and one where both
sides believe that the bible obviously their side that they
keep thinking all they have quote few more passages and the
other side will finally come their that makes things
very frustrating for who realizes that such optimistic
outcome not very
	have stated before that not consider myself but
you believe the existance one creator
not believe the christian the recent discussion
atheists and combined with post another group the
will all has interested the consensus
how god might judge was told that

	can theist truly can impartial
when questioning the truth his
will assume the superstition his parents
when
often found the case that the theist
will stick some kind superstition when
wondering about god and his
seen the the the
and the other theists all assume that
their mothers and fathers were right the
aspect that god and with that belief
search for their
the theist may switch religions
aspects the same but overall the
majority keep the belief that some
was behind the
known muslims who were once christians and vice
known christians who were once
jewish and vice and even known
christians who become throughout
their transition from one faith
kept this belief some form higher
usually all has with how the child
brought from the time the
theist brought with the notion the
some kind the
the the told
this wondrous god who wrote
the the prophets talked about
the the miracles
also told that question this
children are apt crime
against and lose belief the
truth damn soul
the time able read the
scripture for the belief its
ingrained his mind all seems
matter
but stop once the child able
read for there endeavor
inculcate the child the readings
concentrate more the pleasant
gloss over the worse and
explain away the unexplainable with
circular facts and
unreasoning and fear
hell the meat religion the child must eat
every means wrath
some and the child must learn put
away his brain when the matter concerns
all this has some considerable effect the
that when becomes the
superstitions been taught are nearly
impossible
all this leads ask whether the theist can
truly objective when questioning
the and all the
can for put aside this notion that
god exist and look everything from
unbiased point most
theists can especially when presented
with
but can they put aside the assumption
existence and question

	the normal protestant sunday not
and worshipping another day not churches are free
decide the day they will just they are free decide
the would not sin worship some other but
you belong church that worships sunday and you show
you will probably worship
totally agree with that but why you have further
and advocate violating what god has set that the question which
you have not answered from you can worship every
long you but god says the sabbath all

there are those who say that the definition
god happens but that then the statement that god
good has simply says that god does what
that being the one can either love obey god because
the only motive left for obeying him that
just makes sense obey even when

defy him you might end the gas chamber makes
sense obey because has the power punish you you
this ethical theory take radical contradiction
genesis and christianity
any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any
further discussion morality the goodness
does not follow that our moral judgements
are always infallible particular still less our judgements
particular cases about the course action most likely
achieve good
when read the scriptural accounts the actions god
those actions often seem very different from what
might expect god who loves and desires what best for
leaving the scriptures and considering the natural
find that nature often very different from what might
expect were the work benevolent
who believe that the author nature also the author
the scriptures must expect find the scriptures the same sort
difficulties that they find
that some such difficulties should exist not itself
argument against the and goodness
the their absence would such suppose
that watching bobby fisher play and suppose that every
time makes find myself nodding and
just what was expecting him same move would have made
were that would sign that fisher better
chess player than given that expect that
least some his moves will have what suppose
induced him that was real slip
just thrown the game god understands the
workings the universe better than expected that
sometimes will look has made
one difference between fisher the chessboard and god the
controls the universe that can see the end the chess
fisher revise earlier inference that was
carelessness that made him lose his queen moves
and particularly can see that there was
time when had opportunity for checkmate two moves and did
not take then know that not good player had
with the other shall not this life see the total
result some his grounds for judging
that have seen bad move his part must always far shakier
than grounds for making similar judgement about
the book read that ten older
who good found him conspired sell
him into slavery there eventually became and
when there was famine was able provide for his
when his brothers nervously told
not you meant but god turned into
once heard rabbi speak this
the history the jews largely history events
that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued
survival the the
those events turn out the saving the jews
and
the sale joseph his brothers looked like the breakup
the but ended with reconciliation
the quarrel between the famine that drove the family out
canaan looked like misfortune for but
they had stayed they would almost certainly have
intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into
their their oppression the egyptians few
generations after their arrival egypt again looked like
but god used bring them out and into
the promised
here the people built and regularly offered
but the babylonians captured jerusalem and
destroyed temple and city and and deported most
the people you might have thought that that would
the end the people and the but was
living the people had been under constant danger
again and they had turned from the
worship the lord the worship the canaanite fertility
with their ritual prostitution and ritual human
the babylonian captivity put stop never
again did the jews show any interest polytheism
neither the worship the canaanites mor that the
babylonians ever again had foothold among
nor that judaism had been danger becoming
simply system sacrifices and temple the only
prescribed acts worship consisted coming jerusalem
every often and offering during the
with the temple the jews invented the place
meeting for reading and study and discussion the
they came realize what they were
danger forgetting while they continued live
that god not simply local tribal not just the
controller the land the patron the jewish
but the creator the and the ruler and judge
all humans
time and the babylonian empire was replaced
that the and then that the rather
the the antiochus was determined
stamp out and this end made the reading and
the study the torah punishable one might
think that this would the end but was
the people met for and instead reading the torah
portion appointed for the they would read some passage
from the prophets that had similar and then discuss
before this the the five books
moses and
were the only books read and studied the
had not been for the books the prophets would
probably have been forgotten his hatred for judaism
saved
examples here omitted for
some you may remember that julie andrews first became
famous eliza doolittle the stage production fair
when warner brothers undertook make movie
everyone expected that who had been magnificent
would play the same role the the
studio decided with established screen and cast
audrey julie andrews was naturally but she
later realized that she had played the screen she
would have been for life elize doolittle
would have been disaster for walt disney
offered her the role mary and she won oscar for
the she stood and looking
walt she special thanks the
man who made all this possible jack was the most
memorable line the
similar jews might thank the men who
the providence god have preserved and kept alive
this beginning with and continuing
with two with with antiochus
after the formal meeting had broken one woman came him
privately and were talking about the
that example that came your
then you are was talking about but would not
talk about for not everyone can bear assume
that meant without the there would have been
state
someone hearing the lecture might leap the conclusion
that god dependent the wickedness men accomplish his
purposes least that the rabbi thought might then
suppose that the wickedness fact doing that
stirred brothers murderous hate against and
that when the israelites were god hardened
that oppressed the and would not let them
and this raises questions about how action can considered
wicked and the same time considered something that god has
brought
suggest another way looking consider sculptor who has
log wood from which proposes carve but the
instead having smooth even grain has large knot
that spoils the appearance the the sculptor considers
the wood for and then carves statue that features the
that makes that particular interruption the grain and color
the wood correspond some feature the that
observers will fortunate the sculptor was finding
piece wood with knot like that just the right its
presence the crowning the thing that makes the statue
great work the far from being what the sculptor was
looking was challenge his the wood had not
contained that would still have made great work
but different brothers had not sold god
would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish
but would have done another judas had not
betrayed caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected
but had rather acknowledged him the annointed
pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set
jesus might appear that there would have been
and therefore and therefore
not god did not need sin redeem
judas had done then god christ would still have reconciled
the world not know just not know
how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel its
interior had instead been shaped like grand central and
just not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth
game agianst spassky spassky had refused the exchange bishops
and had attacked knight instead bother look
the game making this but the point
none the less
may say both that god the cowardice
pilate accomplish his and that the said cowardice
was not and that pilate would not have thwarted
plans behaving justly and
are make the place where god says
will harden that will not let the people
some christians have taken this mean that pharaoh was puppet
with god pulling the and that his stubbornness and cruelty
were not his own but the work god suppose rather
that what god was telling moses was something like you see
that pharaoh not willing let the people not
suppose that the situation out
purposes will not pharaoh chooses hear you and
let the people well and does will fit his
resistance into and fit perfectly that future
historians and theologians will suppose that would have been
thrown for loss pharaoh had obeyed
return the question that started this all possible
that the slaughtering the moslems are
instruments
first what they are doing just what
brothers did was just what judas did was
they intend for god somehow brings good out that
does not make them any less subject just condemnation and
second god will bring good out but not
the same good that would have brought the serbians had
refrained from the sins robbery and rape and nor does the
good purposes excuse from the duty doing what

how god spoke the god and
the god and the god
luke and after they have scourged they will kill and
the third day will rise
luke and said that the christ
should suffer and rise again from the dead the third

must rise again from the

witnessed against god that raised whom did not
fact the dead are not

	what the objection celebration
the objection naturally the way which you phrase
easter eashtar ishtar ishtarti other the pagan
whore goddess your question
the objection celebration the pagan whore when phrased
that way suspect least would that becomes immeadiately
apparent what objection her would
celebration the resurrection
you are thinking perhaps
not too crazy about the word but certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name the whore
for that stay biblical and call omar rasheet feast
first torah commands that this observed the day following
the sabbath passover any other name modern
why there much objection observing the resurrection
the day the week which actually why jump all
over the calendar the way easter why not just with the sunday
following passover the way the bible has why seek after unbiblical
recall command scripture for celebrate
the but the sole and only reason that
are could not celebrate
what does this question have with easter whore
all for celebrating the just keep that
whore out the
only the name which suggest that
are too concerned about there are lot
words are going have some
terminally people here ottawa want dictionaries
altered that there are negative definitions associated
with the word not offend people
have heard your newspapers speaking the need repave
streets with still think sounds
better
short hope they will also remove the definition
associated with physical
fine and while are the people are
both and probably will have some objections from
that quarter
quebec the word for the celebration the
resurrection etymologically related
pesach and the pascal the
french canadian roman celebration better
because uses the right
that sounds much better there anyone out there would
thinks that phrasing sounds
from this infer that there are different rules for
christians jewish what happened
neither jew nor slave nor male nor for
all are one christ
read the letter now tell was
returned were there different rules upon the slave than upon
how about male and are there different that
apply them there more and can adam
and steve get married each other your there are
differences form and but the way come salvation
messiah remains the same matter what our position
general not favor continuing this
seems but this particular point one that believe
new the objection not having holiday but its
like suggest that people think very carefully about this
words often change their meaning over the days
the week are course originally based pagan some
christians prefer refer however
the majority christians have not been the question
seems whether makes any difference what the dictionary shows
the derivation what people mean and think when
they use
indeed like suggest that postings like this could themselves
suppose people general use easter mean the
celebration postings trying convince
them that they really mean celebration honor some godess run
the risk creating exactly the situation that they claim
they are doing their best linkage minds
between their celebration and the pagan not clear that
this healthy
	hooray always suspected that was human too the desire like
christ that often causes christians very critical themselves and other

since public discussion often most mormons would rather
keep silent than have cherished practice
but there are certain elements the ceremony which participants
explicitly covenant not reveal except conjunction with the
ceremony
the gnostic
had their secret but these seem have been taken entirely
from pagan mystery
there are other interpretations christian history this
one must recall that most what know about the gnostics was
written their eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret
information and john after his and that
those apostles transmitted that information the rest the twelve
irenaeus claims this information was passed the priests and
bishops but eusebius
claims the secret ceremonies the christian church perished with the
interestingly eusebius refers the groups which
today call gnostics promulgators false gnosis
his gripe was not that thay professed
but that they had the
writings dealing with teachings emphasize
secrecy not much concealment policy not teaching
certain things one simon magus opens
dialog with peter the nature response seem
not know what father and god but could tell you
both whence souls and when and how they were but not
permitted now disclose these things
any one theme underlies the
the idea that certain doctrines are not idly but
can had after certain level spiritual maturity
now one can approach this and other such evidence many
intend that everyone interpret christian history but
believe that evidence exists
early christian rites analogous those practiced mormons
neither new testament
christianity nor biblical judaism made secret their
but judaism and christianity had such would you expect
read about them public one can search the book
mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost information
temple you could establish that mormons worship
but you would probably hard pressed characterize that
that can conclude that the bible explains
practices which might have taken and that absence such
descriptions proves they did not

these can also interpreted many different believe
they serve show that not all doctrines which could have been taught

have heard that joseph smith took the entire
practice both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the

change after smith became can argued that smith had

time and through his brother hyrum though specific
connection has yet been

transcriptions which have appeared the have led believe
that the connection from masonry mormonism fairly

will note that nothing the faq said anything about the church
establishing changing the argument against the sabbath
that part the ceremonial and like the rest the
ceremonial law not binding this argument based
and more general
most people argue that scripture shows worship
occuring and paul endorsing understand that these
points are and not want around the dispute one more
the point making here not that these arguments are
but that the backing they claim
accepting the principle does not commit
obeying the entire jewish acts and letters are quite
clear think even the accept the disagreement
where the bible would have place the
the protestants give authority the matters
that are not dictated why churches are free
determine their own church you accept that
the sabbath not binding then the day worship
falls into the category items which individual christians
worship its nature group churches are free
	stowell missed the
affirm the absolutes not because are arrogant
but because believe god who who has revealed his
truth his and therefore hold precious the strategic importance
those
stowell seems have jumped rather strangely from truth
see how that necessarily
all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer either these questions then perhaps you can
how you determine which parts scripture are and
truths are
the answer both questions
all scripture being inspired the evidence for this
claim has been discussed nauseum this
all truth truth
contradiction when something when always
not always then have
contradiction
many people claim that there are absolutes the such
statement terribly let put you this
there are conclude that the
are not absolutely have
contradiction
this just one the reasons why christians defy the world claiming
that there are indeed absolutes the
hardly even evangelical
mention the rest regarding
people sometimes disagree about what this does not negate
the that there are still absolutes the
evangelical still professes believe certain
man man needs and jesus the propitiation
for name any group that does not profess
believe these statements cannot accurately called

very look like one jewish
	humble but exactly what the difference
holding revealed truth with blind faith its basis
any evidence that you may find the
fully expecting people believe you and
they sound like one and the same
see wisdom whatsoever your words
not surprised that you see wisdom that because your
premises are wrong from the word you claim that christianity
based blind but this simply not just look the
current thread the evidence for resurrection for evidence
that jesus was real and that triumphed over
you say that christians hold their beliefs
any evidence that you may find the without any evidence
support your this statement little more than hominem
mind mean this personal merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity this
would make much more sense you could prove that all christians
base their belief empty and that they ignore all evidence
the only then can you expect your attack make

have stated before that not consider myself but
not believe the christian the recent discussion
atheists and combined with post another group the
will all has interested the consensus
how god might judge was told that
might but obviously some people not
even more see atheists and pagans assume would
into this know you believe only
can and not ask you just for your
this probably too simplistic for but john
god loved the world that gave his only that
whoever believes him should not perish but have eternal
genesis believed the and reckoned
him
find anywhere that god restricts heaven particular
ethnic groups religious denominations any other category
that humans like drop people but does require
that believe and trust hebrews says that god spoke
old the prophets old but these last days
has spoken his son jesus and learn
him through the pages the new the bible tells
what need for those who have never leave
them capable will make himself known
behooves each one act upon the knowledge
you reject the claims and still
then the you reject him and
but will
gerry
the opinions expressed
are not necessarily those
	who exactly jesus
john says the little green gideon someone forced one
the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was
the word refers jesus christ from this john declares that god
and jesus are refers david the
psalms refers both god heaven and the coming messiah his once
again this refers god and
what the definition should not
does say anything about this the
some the most people known have not been christians
and some the greatest christians known have been truly
answer your
the bible speaks this many previous post james good
another psalm
who may abide your who may dwell your holy
who walks and works and speaks the truth his heart
who does not backbite with his nor does evil his nor
does take reproach against his whose eyes vile person
but honors those who fear the who swears his own hurt
and does not who does not put out money nor does take

the day techwood meets the wrecking ball the world shall
but have lost former
	the message that are love all and
that all people are preaches message
and all people have
deceitful and are capable turning this message
around and contorting sometimes unbelievable
this also fundamental christian
how wish this were and how long for the day which will
but not true the bible does not have
message has and some those are messages repentance and
turn the other and unto the least but some
the messages are the complete like the isrealites order
wipe out other tribes including women and children down and
punished severely when they were less than complete about the like
jews who are said have cried out blood upon our heads
and our childrens verse quoted every pogrom from the crusades
the have these been think they have only
been understood too essential that christians grasp firmly
the good the bible the meek carpenter from nazareth potent
symbol for how should his teachings must take but
cannot ignore the other material the bible which not our liking and
say those who live that have misread say that only chose
point interpretation and declare such can done with the
same legitmacy instead must let the text critique the
understanding that there both good and bad our sacred test
all things and hold fast that which
believe that line questioning like you presented
strangely compatible with becoming
certainly christianity encourages one question the behaviour
the and especially praise god for
jesus and the fact that can doubt our beliefs
and still come back god and time and time
the risk sounding heretical more think
that doubt something which requires something which
requires introspection and that then there can
for doubt inescapble part being consider
his friends had whereas job had doubt himself but
doubted the wisdom and justice when god finally did appear
rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for christian

	the empty can trust
the late wilbur
when jesus was made amazing prediction about
and frequently repeated let quote for
and the son
man shall betrayed unto the chief
priests and unto the and they shall
condemn him and shall deliver him
the gentiles and and
crucify and the third day shall
rise
wholly different from the normal experience
who had done anything worthy even deserving
knew would die before was years
knew the very city where would knew that the religious
leaders his own race would condemn him knew that
one his own would betray knew that before his actual
death took place would mocked and knew exactly
how would
all this itself but more amazing than the
minute particulars his foreknowledge was what predicted
would follow shortly after was would rise
even designated the the third
but since this central death and
tion jesus the whole truth untruth
tianity let examine more
the body jesus was embalmed long sheets cloth
between the layers which great abundance spices and
ointments was the body was placed tomb which
had never before been and great stone was rolled against
the the jewish fully aware that jesus had
predicted would rise had the stone officially sealed and
saturday placed guard before the tomb prevent the
disciples from carrying away the early sunday morning some
the women who were faithful followers christ went out the
tomb further anoint the their utter
they found the stone rolled the body they rushed back
tell the shortly two peter and
utterly skeptical about the whole came and found the
tomb just the women had even the guards came
hurrying into the city tell the sanhedrin that had hired them
guard the tomb that the body was gone
how did this tomb become
one the most famous new testament scholars
professor new testament literature large theological
the author answer question
the tomb became and wrote letter marked
bitterness that could more explain how the tomb
became empty than could explain how santa claus comes down the
chimney christmas
but realize that santa clause never did come down
any chimney christmas there never was santa
there was buried the
tomb joseph and sunday the body was
those are facts one can escape the
bility coming some conclusion about what really happened
mentioning myth all abandoned before were eight years
another kirsopp lake harvard
tried explain the empty tomb saying other scholar
the field new testament criticism has ventured
that the women went the wrong
the facts are
far there was other tomb nearby
which mistake they could have
contrary all similar experience for three
more people forget the place where they have buried their
dearest loved one within less than three even the women
did miss the when peter and john did they too
the wrong
were the soldiers the wrong
there record attempt escape the
evidence the empty tomb the new testament
now when they were some
the watch came into the city and showed
unto the chief priests all the things that
were and when they were assembled
with the leaders and had taken they
gave large money unto the
say his disciples came and stole
him away while and this come
the will persuade and
secure they took the and did
they were and this saying
monly reported among the jews until this day
this good illustration many later attempts escape the
fact that the tomb was
you will notice once that the chief priests and the elders never
questioned but that the tomb they never even went out
see what the guards had reported was was
another fact about this story makes ridiculous maintain that
the tomb was soldiers were told say that disciples
came and stole the body away
how could they know what was going while they were
such testimony would valueless any
even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make reject
the the very character and the later history the
disciples compel believe they did not steal and secretly carry away
the body
professor heffern points the leaders judaism
who had put the lord jesus had nothing offer
contradict these disciples they continued preach jesus and his
all jerusalem knew the tomb was there
had been trickery sooner later would have been
then
surely the even would
have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they
may possible live but men seldom die for most
these men
the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ
had risen would have suffered the fate all such unfounded
would have lost this truth swept the closed
pagan won millions brought hope despairing
was the very foundation truth the early and today
believable and freshly glorious
but not only did jesus come alive did not disappear
leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days
what had happened
appeared
appeared the women the tomb resurrection morning
later that day mary magdalene alone
and simon also alone the afternoon
walked with two his followers toward emmaus and that
night appeared ten the apostles gathered together upper
room jerusalem luke
week later appeared all eleven the probably
the same place once was seen above brethren
mountain galilee corinthians and finally the
apostles just before his ascension luke acts
with the fact the empty regard these
ically recorded all kinds theories have been proposed
attempting deny their but these theories are
without supporting none has ever won the
unanimous approval those who refuse believe the reality the
while true are living age when may our
leading scientists and agnostics and many our philosophers are
let not forget that some the greatest
thinkers the ages have firmly believed this great
increase president timothy president
nathan president edward president
mark president john president
men and countless others have believed
but suppose christ rise from the what what has
with what has with just
seals with certitude the teachings
jesus taught many great many about
claimed have come down
said was the way
said was the son who alone knew god
said that whoever believed him had eternal and one
else had
said that whatever ask god his would grant
thus when did rise from the grave the third revealed
that these unparalleled spoke the
you know any good why should not believe
that his words are all
the point does not the truth the resurrection convince
that none other than the one claimed son
and the fact that christ rose from the dead
testifies that has broken the power and that will some
day raise also from the
other this jesus the son all
should the cornerstone the foundation your for
said life built him would know forgiveness his
ionship and joy that circumstances can ever take and
hope that shineth more and more unto perfect
those who have tried down through the there have been
given their and today who believe also
	throughout this there are statements and questions which
could easily interpreted being they are have written
this reply the most manner that with emotions boiling
the surface was please accept this serious attempt
foster dialog and rest assurred that make every attempt make fun
except myself
not posting here immature flame
but rather express opinion intended
the human being who due advanced
developed religious satisfiable solution
the
there are other animals this planet with advanced
mental facilities which have not developed
satisfactory explaination for the why this
appears that only humans have explain the
why this the other animals this
including those with advanced mental seem perfectly
content their
like point out that your presuppositions scream out
from your unsupported they humans are animal
religion exists crutch that the unexplained need
not religion was humans address
perceived the biological aspect humans deified
all aspects human life can categorized hierarchical
structure with biology the
needless disagree with your strong opinion and the
underlying
infectious the reasons flourishes are
gives people without hope driven purpose life
safety blanked hide have
this christian moral standard and get eternal
all you how many you were the
disagree that christianity infectious has
certainly shown itself persistent belief
spite various persecutions throughout the past two
that continues persevere does not demonstrate that
derrogatory may that provides
workable system for its adherents would argue that this
the
disagree that christianity safety which supplants
hope and points individual the one
source hope and there nothing hidden about
source for hope and what usefulness
you the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose
and externally given hope and the loss
control over own life the problem something
one does not appropriate following
christian moral the sole reason for the existance
christianity standards are inadequate save people
from their moral standards are merely guides the
the real power moral living given the christian
the person
heaven one two final states that
christian doctrine christians are generally
not motivated live according christian moral standards this
promised future they are motivated the perceived
benefits them the
the other reason christianity flourishes its
best friend mine breifly entered christian
and within they set ministry guidelines for him which
said this spread the
many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism
and rightly was jesus himself who gave this
priority for his not the penultimate
priority evangelism normally understood preach the
convert nearly any repeat with new convert
such evangelism generally best done through respecting
the opinions others while the very real benefits
christian this demonstration should powerful
that compels the seek out the christian ask
needless such demonstration not easily
plished takes radical committment the person
does not happen quickly perseverance the part the christian
and cannot occur where personal bonds
friendship exist ineffective with strangers who cannot
evaluate the demonstration over and easy alienate
harm others the sole purpose being gain
christian view with some
ticism evangelism programs which incorporate
pressured conversions may ultimately worse than
conversion all the pressured convert realizes was
coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open
the future had they not been taken advantage
the bible states that the very spirit god which brings
conviction content part
and let the spirit the
are need and and
are far more than and die
just other animals are also capable more
than your personal vision humanity
can only hope and pray that you will someday find
more expansive
what animals have the wide variety performing
arts that humans how that humans can learn the language
other humans but that other animals cannot
how that humans can organize themselves various social
structures whereas other animals have only one
nothing more than
blatant christianity not physically
christianity not psychologically christianity not
which one relationship
with living you might validly characterize any
knit relationship with this
people use drugs escape from christians inject
with jeezus and live with that
there are who let the emotional aspects worship
and christian living gain the upper even
this does not itself invalidate the foundation from which these
things
pities how many millions lives have been lost religious
which christianity has had small
guilty that which forces itself
upon another not christianity
christians see they say that person blind
the but they cannot realize that who live
this mask fakeness each jesus was just prophet
happened have large influence because that time the romans
dispersing the jewish population and communities
some sort cohesive element keep them strong that time
dire
you appear have amazing certainty about what really happened
years how did you come
cannot accept your conclusion that influence was sole
result the roman sack jerusalem was years
gone this strains the bounds credulity assert
that nothing about life was noteworthy the
must these are but few thoughts
christianity having relationship with jesus christ
what you know
read the world phil buckland
	from meagre knowledge the seems that christians have
hard the jews day for being cautious about accepting
that their religious authorities accept the
this good christ was hardly the only person who claimed
the number were active the area from the
time the roman conquest after the fall
many the statements made the their repeated
attempts give jesus sword him military point the fact that
they realize the true nature his reign until after the many
the statements the bible can seen being oriented toward explaining
this new definition the jews who were being preached

when your authority starts telling you you should ask

bible says that looks the heart the
from that grading the heart
final
very one might also say that life open book
	think was lewis who said that the principals
marry each the church and the state are present merely
not just lewis summary standard catholic
however this mean that the presence those
except odd situations like the standard
originally wrote the person who asked this question
but decided post the information had the
spoke the pastor parish
this his explaination was that
while possible for couple marry without the presence
important have recognized the
church soon because the church
recoginizes itself community members
the some are held accountable
each less hypothetical than that mythical
couple the desert there are many places the
world that not have priests availible for marriages
regular couples get married without
the priest being but get the priest testify
their marriage when one comes through the
remember religion teacher high school saying
that the marriage ceremony not for the benefit the couple
much for the benefit the
married couples have some responsibility the community
stay divorce sets bad example for the
the couple has vowed become one with
one community should able rely that
couple
while couples may marry without they
may not get anulments without priest
anulment simply admission the church that what
they had declared marriage was marriage
for whatever start getting married
the back seat station wagon and giving yourselves
anulments
tend agree with the response back there that
said couples become married soon they consumate their
but would add that couples should consider their
marriage consumated they have whether not they
intended assuming they were both willing
partners the sexual the couple must prepared
raise any children they may have result that
sexual act with the benefit both sex

	just about closed this once now doing for after
	coming from long line know temper when see
one the tell tale that give away
when their net replies are angry and
hope that you are not suggesting that merely because person
replies angry and manner that this
demonstrates their the simple fact that there
not christian the face the planet know that
have been known times have fit
but this does not make any the less
one the points being christian perceive become
more like this statement inherently suggests that are not
already like jesus never unrighteously lost his
jesus was
the net village have laugh two when born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
instead answering questions with sweetness and
these chrisitan the
you must understand that this because christians often forget
treat others our christ this because are
human and for not pretend and
hope that will bear with when make this
surely not too much when make every effort bear with
you need any you already yourselves the greatest
and know
again
again are all
duticci has valid point and christians ought heed the
warning her oftimes discredit ourselves and our
the way that treat strive towards the goal set
our but the remember
condemnation for those who are
when you blow easy forgive your
father heaven forgives and remember and this something
firmly beieve and cling one shall see him face

when are judged the are being discipled
that will not condemned with the
cor though not physically with you
and have already passed judgment the one who did just were
cor spiritual man makes judgments about all but
himself not subject any
who has known the mind the lord that may instruct but have the
mind
jude the seventh from prophesied about these
the lord coming with thousands upon thousands his holy ones judge
and convict all the ungodly all
the ungodly acts they have done the ungodly and all the harsh words
ungodly sinners have spoken against

sign arrogance some may only sign that they are
following the bible
jude merciful those who snatch others from the fire and
save others show mixed with fear hating even

this sounds much but tempted does god

this argument sounds like god does not but

you being the source including

better understand the classical concepts necessary and

somewhere that hell might state once having been human
why that have this notion that god takes some sort pleasure
from punishing the purpose hell destroy the devil and

the earlier poster who tried support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not remember the bible
teaches that god has reserved them until the day their

excellent question and anxious see there are
such doubt the medieval period

the when you count people knowing even
basics logic seeing through good argument
indistinguishable from poor
the last sentence since many readers
seem not embarrassed apologists such
josh mcdowell and
followed whatever discussion there may have been these
but feel that lewis excellent apologist and
see reason for you think that errors and flawed
arguments are reason for dismissing you must dismiss
nearly every thinker from descartes any philosophy course
will introduce you their
the above also expresses rather odd sense
what makes you think the masses who were
mostly knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
cream the could read and everyone
the medieval period the was matter uncritically
accepting what they were
said nothing about however comparing
our day and day really read ortega gasset
talking about the familiar experience arguing all night and
winning logic and only discover your opponent

	responding the
what believe and rely are important areas personal
what bothers when others suggest these
their specific beliefs are not only true them
are absolute and should binding follows from this
god must give everyone the same revelation and thus
who comes different conclusion intentionally choosing
wrong this the arrogance lack respect for the
conclusions others matters which are between them and
certainly reasonable ask for some humility about our own
know the there are also different paths some
but like see more clarification about what
mean when you reject the idea saying specific beliefs
not only true them but are absolute and should binding
something true for assuming that
belief something about
what trying point out matters faith
tenets which are not logically one may convinced
the truth certain things for personal
and its certainly fine share that revelation those
beliefs with and think that its
accepts matters pure faith truth for where think the
conflict arises assuming where disagreements beliefs
all others have been given the same and that god
must reveal his truth everyone such way that all would
honestly think this can lead the conclusion that anyone
who disagrees with you are being sinful that they are
rejecting something they truth because inconvenient
for because they wish spurn
would say that this equivalent assuming that truths one
holds are universal and and the problem see with this
that negates the individuality humans and their relationships with
this does not mean there absolute just that some areas
doctrinal disagreement may areas where god has not established

creed has always been western
and has always had the the orthodox have said that
accept all that with the exception the but
not
which exactly what pointed was wrong about your use
the the catholic encylcopedia which read about
said the orthodox use the creed minus the apparently that
has the athanasian creed has always had the the
nicene constantinopolitan did
course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene
creed there begin but they certainly did from the
athanasian which did have from the
might point out that the whole problem started over the difference
ways explaining the generation the blessed the east
emphasizing the idea the holy spirit proceeding from the father
through the and the west using proceeding from the father and the
such used both formulations
the form these profess that
call god and his the father and and his for the
root and the stem are two but the fountain and the
river are two but the sun and the ray are two
but coherent anything which proceeds from another must
necessarily second that from which but not
that account separated from where there there
are and where ther there are the
third from god and the just the third from the root the fruit
the and third from the fountain the stream from the
and thrid from the sun the apex the
against
and
believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father
through the
against
and thomas showed his summa theologica part question
articles and there contradiction between the two methods
and the two methods reckoning the procession
emphasize what among others that the holy spirit
proceeds from the father and the but proceeds from the father
more preeminent
whatever the son has from the certainly has
from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for the
father alone not from for which reason alone called
the but the practice
and those who employ such terms they are able
matter the born the and the holy
spirit proceeds principally from the and since the father gives
the son all that has without any interval the holy spirit
proceeds jointly from both father and would called son
the father and the son which abhorent everyone sound
they had both begotten the spirit was not begotten
but proceeds from each and
augustine the
all the formulations are correct the west
because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and but
proceeding from the the orgin that procession the
procession from the the holy spirit proceeding from the
father through the but all that the son has from the
the holy spirit can said proceed from the without any
mention the son being

who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic
which enunciated
for the issue the adoption another creed being
will point out that the holy fathers ephesus and chalcedon both spoke
the creed nicea their statement forbidding anyone
compose confession faith other than the one defined
the fathers that creed different creed than that
which commonly called the nicene not
course that they were condemning the adoption the
constantinopolitan which but enlargement upon the creed
but that they were condemning the impious opinions
who had adopted radically different creed from the one used the
which among other things denied the procession the holy
spirit form the the additions the constantinopolitan
creed were not thought violation and the council
chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine the procession the holy
spirit from the which nestorius they could hardly have been
against explaining fuller way the for they themselves
approved previous additions and the further explanations
the creed made constantinople were not denigrating the work
done the holy fathers nicea any way follows
that the council toledo was fully able add what was not disputed
the faithful the creed combat the impieties the arians
because the filioque was not dispute the church until
many years later under photius and and that the filioque was

while main posting goes
this response question about
the immaculate explained but left justification
our catholic
there direct reference the holy scripture except for the
mention grace the
angel gabriel luke
and the month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto
city named virgin espoused
man whose name was the house and the
name was and the angel came unto her and
thou that art highly the lord with blessed
art thou among
hold that line thought lord with mary
blessed art thou among while you read
the lady the popular history

the matter really far more complicated
than the this arose quite possible
that the feast under the title conception
saint originally commemorated the
woman the child conceiving
just elizabeth had conceived john the transfer
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought anne the miracle
grace wrought god the soul mary was mary
the incorruptible timber which was hewn the
sinless she whom there
tree and serpent that her perfect
beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar her
purity that the the time the council
she was hailed without
holy soul and who was blessed lily from
among unlearned the evil ways
the end the thirteenth irish
john duns scotus maintained that was
greater thing for him preserve his mother from all
sin use his power clease her from
now the discussion baptism and original
from catholic john
baptism
concupiscence remains after
concupiscence the tendency sin remains the baptized
but since left provide has power
injure those who not consent and who the grace
christ manfully resist
original gifts adam and eve before their
the light the see that our first
parents were originally gifted three times
had the natural gifts human beings especially the
power think and choose
had the gifts bodily immortality
and the internal power control
had the gifts sanctifying
the virtues and charity and the corresponding
title enter
their they lost the and
gifts and were weakened
their natural capacity reason and choose
baptism restores the life lost
restore the gifts
but gifts title glorified restoration our
bodies the last
going back
not sure this interpretation any other
books but may another contribution the
given the miracle anne bearing child
and christ was not yet born
and was baptism birth but
the angel greetings
full the lord with
blessed art thou amongst
even mary was confused about this
mary could very well have possessed all the
original gifts given our first
parents and eve before their
hail mary praise given the angel
full grace
the lord with you those god would
definitely want with those
has made
blessed art thou amongst women says
the god made mary grace
and the for the coming body
christ and
immaculate conception mary true and mary still
has maintained her immaculate
hope that others will continue more
light and facts this
	think really sad that many people put their faith mere
even did claim the son
pose question here got what distinguishes
religion from cults speaking generally not specifially
jerry falwell was good morning america
ostensibly answer this said that
religion follows message whereas cult follows
christianity cult because the message christianity
the person what for the
davidian from the presbyterian doctrinal
answer the use them
far can one the big differences between davidians and
christians who they have sometimes tried put myself
the feet one they gave
lot possibly and whole follow
what the quite jesus was good and
david koresh was
the problem that try legislate what good
and what bad terms for there are thousands
laws the governing what legal and what hard
bring people because not possible find
legal way only could trust judges
then could tell them administer justice and justice
would but since judges always get
have complicated system involving precedent and bunches
other stuff which attempt make the imperfect justice
into something but what hear about the justice
system the tells that quite the opposite
there also problem that tend judge the presentation
more than the material being might consider
ranting christian but eloquent person from another
religion this goes along with the american desire
protect the constitution all even allows
people bad
think that the message that man
presenting false even ever ever mild
then that man performing tremendous
know that rambling guess that what trying
say that looking for principles that tell
why the davidians got not wrong follow and
worship but important choose the right
choose and you got choose
anyone and you got because jesus the
begotten son and nobody else jesus was without and
nobody else

	good catholic convert attracted the
rational tradition and the emotional authenticity
with the faddishness roman
never had much time for the pope any other heirarchs but and
believe the sacremental always felt quite happy
look down nose those such john emery few posts who
had engage circuitous textual arguments prove their entirely
oblivious the fact that dozen other faiths can the same
miracles and that since their arguments depend the belief the
bible sole was not very good logic argue
that the bible proved was happy accept the church
was the church after all that existed before the the
church that choose grace the canon protestant
was shown protestants breathtaking acceptance
right reject dozen books
but recently read peter and very
well and well but raises some very upsetting
the early christians were weird even more than
carzy they had odd views odder views the
totally ludicrous views about and distinctly uncharitable
views about other human
now the question were the first christians just
but got used did the pristine the
happen within one certainly have
wait until the triumph the church under
wha does this say about promise always support the
use throwing the usual protestant pieties about the church
not being organization community
and was the early communities that were the institional
church was model sanity
would interested serious catholic and orthodox responses
this entirely serious not sure issue for protestants
with their alone with but for who see the
over time and the weird early
christians are
exaggeration the protestant many protestants
have strong appreciation for the role the soul
alone with certainly important for but
means the whole
have read the sort history you talk you point
protestants have quite the same problem you because
believe that the church had fall some however protestant
mythology typically places the fall around the time constantine
more regard happening sort cumulative
starting from constantine but getting worse the pope accumulated
power during the medieval the consequences having
earlier are somewhat worrisome even most protestants accept
the theological results the early ecumenical including
such items the trinity and indeed the works
reformers such luther and find church fathers such
augustine quoted all the think find many
protestants resistant the idea that the early church whole was
additional problem for protestants that
much want talk about this since been looked
recently the question whether one can really think
augustine and other fathers being their views
the authority the are not entirely congenial
protestant
one thing that somewhat worries question
there are certainly plenty wierd people the early what
concerns that they may overrepresented what
see every christian who courted but think good
reason believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than
see the heroic but think good reason
think that many christians were happily help
suspecting that the early church had the same range wierdos and
sane people that think also certain level
active history the mean that
manufacturing things out whole but you think
there might tendency emphasize the
	the new testament have bible and
provide women are instructed silent and cover
their heads this your
this truth and therefore
women your church they cover their all
absolute seems that women speaking and
church with bare heads should intolerable
women speak evangelical churches and come with bare
least this was the case the evangelical churches grew
are clearly not taking this particular part scripture
absolute there are plenty other
you reconcile
the problem you see here that some christians claim things about
the bible which they actually believe known
all sorts ranging from the trendiest liberals
the and although many the
conservative side the christian faith claim that the bible
source absolute know anyone
who treats anything other than valuable part living
while not roman believe this close the official
position the church would like
the particular practice you refer will usually explained
terms the social context the you would think the fact
that the conservatives seem have break out the
and give you some big routine about why this
passages directly applicable today would
show them that what they claim about the bible and what they
actually practice are two different but mostly
while this thread supposed about the arrogance
would suggest that some the problem really this
making claims about the bible which the claimants actually
put into but step back from the and
look what people are attempting see that they are trying
express very concisely the unique place the bible holds within the
christian when people use such words phrases
only rule faith and practice the church describe the
should try hear what they are saying and not just look
the mere words they some the above descriptions are demostratably
false and others are but experience people are
generally pretty good picking out the intention the speaker even
when the words are variance with their biblical
example from the garden eden where god asks are and adam
explains that was naked and afraid and hid adam had
answered words would have said something like here this
the problem seems arise when christians insist that these
words are indeed accurate reflections their most people
have not made determined effort work out their own understanding
the place the bible within their own faith and rely the phrases
and explanations that others
hope this

most the feast the resurrection our lord
known the some variation word
which comes from the hebrew meaning
and few related known
some variation and questions have been asked about the
origin this
one explanation that given the venerable bede his
ratione temporum where derives the word from the name
goddess spring called bede great
and natural take his word for but lived
and augustine began preaching kent the use
the word easter describe the feast would have been well
established before the birth bede and probably before the birth
anyone might have discussed the subject seems likely
that his derivation just based his awareness that
there had been goddess spring bearing that
and the resemblance the the said resemblance
not surprising that personification spring should
have name similar the word for not istelf
the testimony rather the bede does
not make more
assuming that bede was that would not justify saying that the
christian celebration after had been going for some
centuries before the name easter was applied has pagan
would simply mean that the upon becoming christians
and beginning celebrate the resurrection festival every
called the name that them meant simply
not the only theory that has been
zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft
offers the following
among the week beginning with the feast
the resurrection was known
since the christians were accustomed wear their
white baptismal robes throughout that sometimes the week was
referred simply translaters rendering this into
german mistook for the plural meaning they
accordingly rendered which old high german for
this gave rise the form easter
james kiefer
not interested restarting discussions the propriety
celebrating however this seems like contains enough
interesting information that people might like see
	one the tell tale that give away
their net replies are angry and
the net village have laugh two when born again
verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won
and had originally joined the discussions because they were
instead answering questions with sweetness and
these chrisitan the
although certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness
unloving and little disturbed the formulation that
ill temper not christian seems like false argument
say that anyone who displays trait must not could
well sinning but christian
anger and christians are
christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
everyone not perfect righteousness but the effort seeking
righteousness that marks dedicated and one the greatest
gifts faith that seeking and accepting forgiveness for
expecting flawless behavior from self others
	for why does the universe exist
there not have find this
there why and spend our lives then have merely
our which were meaningless there why and
find this view christianity quite disheartening and
the idea that life only has meaning importance there creator
does not seem like much basis for
please forgive all the suppose they are neccessary follow
the
point that life has meaning importance then should try
find that meaning which almost hope
not being too one term for that meaning
though that not obvious from above
and the logic also must exist because want him
more like therefore therefore god
have heard this line before and wonder how prevalent
certainly modern society many people are convinced life
hopeless the pollsters and newscasts but see
where this good reason become you want
why not just join such the leaders will give you
the security blanket you
unfortunately the term ambiguous this
could say that searching for meaning life definition being
could say cult followers definition have given
the
you want why not search for the
understanding christianity congruent with understanding
there have been many before who have come conclusions
that are worded ways that make sense means does that imply
that understand

there are numerous accounts jewish both the new
testament and roman and greek documents the
not sure jewish proselytism but would like relate
account recent dinner had with jews few months
the dinner was instigated the aunt the whom had met while
visiting wife galveston last the dear old aunt
was very proud her jewish although not especially
her parents were both murdered nazi concentration camps
austria during wwii because they were while conversing with her
about world affairs and she remarked that would
good idea for visit her niece return
within two days returning her niece called invite
over for dinner with her not knowing really what
other than stimulating conversation and what
was rather the thrust the discussion
was condemn the policies prohibiting abortion counseling
federally funded family planning prohibiting the sterilization
minorities welfare here and puerto
the ban fetal tissue and against the mexico city
denies foreign aid programs overseas that promote
the crux their position was place the blame for the problems
rampant domestic african unwed
rather the fall this
not what had come talk but every time tried
bring the subject they would condemn jews for jesus
and admonish against converting involves
too much study and and did not even raise the nor
try convert them the truth there was certainly
jewish proselytism going
and last november toured jewish synagogue and was
subjected harangue against jesus and christianity
realize that these are two isolated and that the
best supervisor ever had work but from
the modern jew not known for his
boundary

indistinguishable from poor
the last sentence since many readers
seem not embarrassed apologists such

what makes marriages
marriage not necessarily wrong there
nothing the bible new about getting married
priest and fact jewish
priests have never had any connection with
there common notion that the marriage performed the
the traditional christian view least the
that the bride and groom are the ministers the
and that the clergyman there only
the essential ingredient marriage mutual two
persons are considered married and only they have bound
themselves mutual promises live together husband and
forsaking all till death them
the reason why those who have reason concerned about who
married whom have always insisted some kind public
ceremony order that and the couple may
clear about whether commitment has been
suppose that away with the public the standard
have man and woman settling down live
after year the man says the
was great while but think time move
she what are you talking
leaving you and looking for someone prettier and
she but you are
what are you talking never got
she remember distinctly what you said the night
first made you love for you deep the
eternal the long
utterly and when lie last feeble
breath will utter your
that was just just when
man romantic bound say all kinds silly
things like you take them
and that why you have insistence formal ceremony that
matter public
the church insists because her duty other
give moral and you cannot give man moral advice
about his relations with woman you have idea who married
and vice
the state insists since the state has concern with
property with child care and and therefore needs
know who has made what commitments
prospective insist because they
want their daughters seduced and
prospective spouses insist because they want make
sure they know whether what they are hearing real
just
and persons making vows themselves insist making them
formally and order that they may clear their own
minds about what that they are and may know themselves
that this not just this the real
hence the insistence formal public explicit avowal the
marriage the church goes further and insists when
christians clergyman shall present the wedding and
record the vows behalf the not because
impossible have valid wedding without but order
make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching
about marriage and that they are fact promising married
christian the church also prefers standard marriage
and wary letting couples write their own for much
the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they
draw will certain language has been repeatedly
used and one can sure how the courts will interpret
try say the same thing your own and you may find that
the probate interpretation them not all what you
the church prefers avoid endless debates
about whether are main and here for the long
fact cover the same territory all
and death
this topic has come the list there any topic
that one listmember was couple love each
other and are living that marriage the eyes
eventually someone that what their status
they break that the moral equivalent getting
are they relationship that god forbids either them walk
out the original questioner never thought
there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that
someone who need piece paper ceremony
front judge preacher order show that love each
trying have both ways have the advantages
marriage plus the option changing his mind with minimum
this point someone may this applies and
are quite clear the fact that have assumed lifelong
better forsaking all till death
our ceremony
this reply would the reason for requiring
license keep dangerous drivers off the what wrong
itself not the existence unlicensed but the existence
dangerous testing and licensing drivers
obvious and reasonable means pursuing the goal reducing the
number dangerous drivers the therefore the state rightly
makes and enforces such and you the citizen have positive
moral obligation refrain from driving without license matter
how much hotshot behind the wheel you think you
back the original have listmember who knows
couple who have been living together for around
what point did they stop fornicating and start being
the where they both definitely and
explicitly accepted obligation faithful each for
better long they both they have accepted
such what are their reasons for not being willing
declare front justice the
james kiefer
	not the original just answering because
think this
result human rather than the will
certain sense but the sense that god allows evil
when obviously being could have not had
certain sense mean that wills god does not
but instead uses for you what
must seperated from what actually for
desires that all should timothy
obvious that nowhere near all are was will
because his will cannot for even when appears that
your will doing actually the will god which
grace has disposed come the age old
why does evil which must answer that god allows
though does not condone that his ultimate plan
brought suggest reading the parts
summa theologica thomas that deal with the knowledge god
get good grasp this whole
going have very careful with language
think god voluntarily giving his omniscience this world
that can decide our own where free this sense
god allows evil and this sense can
chaplain his will that all
not going save have take
step his direction before will save read that last sentence
carefully not saying save saying have
accept our not believe predestination would
appear from what you say further down that you
not saying that anyone deserves punishment more than someone
simply pointing out that god could using the serbians and
instruments his did with the
against the
have trouble with but guess one those things
that resolved accept your
issue not questioning why god has made the world the way god
whether discerning the world the way god
the debate about whether should not oppose the serbians
their because they might the will
said christians should not participants such wars and
that does not mitigate the fact that god allows this evil
for patient and willing that none should
for those whom has foreknown turn him from their
this what indicates that you may believe
not believe predestination believe all
choose whether not will accept gift salvation
fundamental difference which really
more
not saying that the evil befalling the bosnians justified
saying that possible that god punishing them
this way this evil that does not mean
god cannot use evil further his not accusing the
though they may very well guilty great but that
god are all defendants when the time comes for our
let all sincerely hope and pray that will have
christ our advocate that
god but will only mete out that
punishment the last for evil can done
human beings that not will and the best can see
taht some good comes out the thing that most worries
about the the will argument that this will
convince people that should not stop the rape and killing when
think that most just jesus stopped
the stoning adulterous woman this not good
but going with why should not stop
the murder and violation people who may may more

one rule thumb that person making the they are
was just reading john this morning think that the
right anyway close and have bible work
check and jesus talking his disciples about his
impending death and says that will going away and then later
will with said something along the lines will
you and you will cannot provide the exact
quote understanding this that
the second coming will not outward inward
christ will come live our hearts and will live
you look for person you will
seems that the jews had been looking for messiah that would
political military leader and recognize jesus when
jesus tried show that his kingdom was not this
lot what have seen written about the second coming seems
based expectation christ coming back and finally taking over
the world and running the way should sounds lot like
what the jews were looking the first coming like that and
see reason for the second coming like that

	wanted the jewish people accept him the
crucification was the will god how could jesus pray that this
pass from was this out many men and
have given their lives for their country other noble
jesus less than knew the crucification
not the will will was that the jewish people accept
the messiah and that the kingdom heaven established
earth with jesus like the jewish people
this had happened years ago can you imagine what
why you assume that plea his father let this cup
pass from was merely plea escape when look
jesus the see who all his life had had the
presense his father with knew every
detail about his death long before the agony the but
that hour felt abandoned his his
presense diminishing with each passing
was brought more and more attention betrayal
judas was probably big that his suffering would
avail for many especially those who would reject not
only then but the truly believe that the majority
suffering was mental and while the physical
portion was only the tip the
know from account that jesus becomming earthly
from
joh after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus they
began this the prophet who come into the
joh knowing that they intended come and make him king
withdrew again mountain
this does not seem like man who would regret not becoming
earthly jesus knew his mission was redeem all
people and establish his kingdom the hearts those
who would this was utterly much
aspiration some earthly but knew
what his will was and followed obediently even the
darkness his

	first paragraph and the mention pantheism
and just not cup none this
speak for but understood his comment refer
the idea that unrecognized pantheism dangerous
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed

christianity and reject what

the underlying assumptions every book program watch

philosophies and doctrines are what give form the events our
they are the basis from which live our lives love and
the command love god with all mind means

his thoughtful christians from most traditions
recognize that consumerism has place the lives

pointing out the
	the excellent post deleted for space
all the suffering and persecution that meant
quite probable that least one those the supposed
conspiracy
come forward and confess that the whole thing was big

risen
the especially light the sufferings that came upon
those
was the conference this year pittsburgh and the
speaker there spoke this talked about many the same
things you mentioned your but here went into little more
paraphrase best
you were part the which was going
tell people that christ had never mind the the being
burned the possible crucifixion just talk about
the whip that would used would have broken
and anything else that they could find attached you would
stood facing with nothing protect
the whip hit you the first would tear the flesh off you
with instant incredibly intense you would think yourself
this for the second hit would drop you your you would
scream out agony that your raw back was being torn you would
say this for and you had more
the third hit you would scream out that was all beg for them
and tell them that you would swear your life that had all
been they would only
amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such
but for there one fool enough and

the standard work detecting forgeries ancient documents
probably the writing friedrich und
und vol
der klassischen
portions this are described
prophetic book deseret
you want attempt reading this nibley
describes blass typical german scholar who claims little
knowledge his then proceeds exhaust both the subject
and the extract from work the form
for makes interesting
confess that have not read only extract
german falls far short what would required and
far know there english translation
believe the techniques describes are known widely enough that
any competent classical scholar could examine purportedly ancient
document and least determine consistent with what one
would expect genuine document that time will not
able prove who wrote but least should able
determine with reasonable confidence from that time and
culture later
actually there are types purportedly ancient
alleged actual holographs early copies for example
the dead sea these can tested various scientific
means determine the age the and objects found
with this can provide pretty clear dating the actual
physical
documents claiming copies ancient works although the
copy itself may much more for example might find
document which monks monastary claim copy something
from centuries ago even having been through several
generations this more problem but can still
tested the test not likely cannot
expect test the age the physical objects tell much
must confine our testing the text
important remember that none these tests can tell
the document really what claims they can only date the
document and identify its culture for example heard
letter supposed have been written jesus himself king
what now this document were actually turn
scholars could date the paper and ink they have the
they could check the content and writing
style see they are consistent with what would expected
palestinian jew that however even all test results were
positive there way determine jesus himself actually
wrote would know what time and culture came from but
known sample jesus handwriting other clues for
scholarship must stop there seldom any way
determine who the actual author
expert remember some the
tests which can applied alleged copies ancient
specifically might
the document internally does contradict
the work short would relatively easy
maintain internal even the
longer the forgery the more difficult maintain
for this reason most successful forgers stick short
consistent with the history and geography the
again work might not testable but the
writing any significant length forger would
able escape here look for the inconspicuous
things which someone from that culture would get right without even
thinking about but which later forger would find too numerous
and trivial the devil the
what about the literary style the figures speech
any ancient writer would almost certainly speak ways that
seem strange are there any such odd phrases this
they fit with the
course there are complications the document has been
possibly even somebody just updated language
when copied few cases language not from the culture
claimed may allowed recent they cause problems and
reduce certainty sure but necessarily prove
these tests can quite effective enough material work
but they are not they require the skills the
the the anthropologist the questions
ask every aspect this document consistent with what
know about the culture claimed there are things
which fit how significant are are problem areas due
our lack later changes copists are they really
there will often some ambiguity since never
know everything about the
the end result any such testing occasionally certain
the case holographs other ancient
however often may just probability indication that
the document maybe parts probably authentic
sometimes maybe other parts are later this often

	have question for you all related jesus condemns divorce
several times the new and have hard time with
the catholic church far can does grant annulments with
the statement that the marriage never really existed
correct have
witnessed marriages where two people were very much love but
recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other
staying and that the problems were due personal
childhood issues that had never been ask divorce
justified such they knew who they what they were
they were deeply but the did not work
must admit that see jesus forcing them live
even condemning that they and seek happiness with someone else

that allow you might there range
catholics and some others will say that divorce never

for other serious separation allowed all traditions
that one should forced stay situation where
they are others see last resort situations
that have fallen apart badly enough that the best can hope for
choose the lesser some sense the difficult legal
question turns out not but because
statement mark and with many other
this turns your approach the conservative
protestants tend see statements like this having
more liberal ones are willing make allowances for situations where
literal interpretation would lead painful noted
that the time was possible for man divorce his wife almost
thus common explanation the more liberal approach
that jesus was trying protect people from this sort not
establish absolute rule which there could never
typical with catholic take
theoretical hard but allow for exceptions practice through
the process the last discussion most our
readers seemed accept with some reluctance that
some cases there might good but there was
feeling that the church should often doing better job

come during and that properly run divorce

but will you turn when your turn
	the real problem was
that christians were pacifist and preached there was only one when the
state operates system divinitation the emperor monotheism
becomes capital the jews were able get exemption from
and were also not
disagree with your claim that jews were not evangelistic
the narrow sense the jewish proselytism was
there are numerous accounts jewish both the new
testament and roman and greek documents the
	love the bible
the way the wicked abomination unto the but
loveth him that followeth after proverbs
for the lord knoweth the way the but the way
the ungodly shall psalm
extremely uncomfortable with this way phrasing love
are capable
rejecting love but never fails love
these verses not show that love qualified but rather that
opposed
uncomfortable with the tract general because there seems
innappropriate emphasis god deserves our love and worship
because who not like the idea frightening people into
accepting
see evangelism combining way living that shows love with
putting into words and explaining that preaching the gospel
without living the gospel better than being noisy gong
clanging
how many you are christians because you are
afraid going how many are responding
	follow god have you ever asked
blind person why she follows seeing eye
answer quite dog can and the blind person
you may cannot trust own
know whether what see and hear about god truth
that why need faith must force
believe that god knows the and loves
share with even when defies what think
why would have created did not love
help through this
seems you learned differentiate between illusion and
reality your own you need rely doctrines that
need experience christianity
that most christians seek answers from clergymen who have little
direct experience spiritual and that most
these questions can answered simple most
people suspect that they cannot trust their but few take
the next step figure out that they can trust not
get too but seems that most christianity
are founded particularly intuitive people who understand
for one can you must
follow god your own you are ever
all christians wish share with
the love have received from you reject
have accept your although always keep
offer open you really want find out
believe what can only suggest you try
for reading the and asking christians
their experiences
and what the original never
does make sense that she the majority humanity
for that would hell for many
christians makes more sense that rather
than converted doctrine that holds
life for that she simply continue decide for herself
what
may right about christians relying but have some
reason hope protestants emphasize
experience the holy and use the this intended
make sure that christians have religious experience their
and that they have some basis which judge claims clergy and
other speak for catholics and but
believe they also attempt avoid having members who simply repeat
what they are admit that this always successful
certainly see young people join our church because that age parents
expect but most our members seem quite able and willing
make judgements for and have commitment that comes out
their own the nature usenet
that doctrinal disagreements get looks like spend
most our time dealing with certainly not
experience the way christians really
	this somewhat but pleas read

some more verses that and perhaps answer the second

for knowing bit people normally have
consciences which warn them about
conscience can hardened deceitfulness
that the person has idea care about that they are
there are those sins which when know
that sinful begin those take searching and examining
scripture find out that they are sinful and then repent and
the best question ask every circumstance judge sinful

	the problems with catholic liturgy are likely continue for
some the problem the liturgy
symbolic action other words catholics believe that
the during the mass
etc are that the sprinkling water bestows
almost the vestments are real indication real
sacred the point that understood all
connected underlying real this kind thinking
precludes holy water not holy because
simply
modern westerners find extremely especially
think the mass are more likely
see action that represents but which
could replaced with other concrete this means the
mass has become commercial for grace rather than the real
you can mess around with commercial way you
dare with the real thing these attitudes have
been encouraged liturgy which instead focusing
have focused how create meaning
you can only create symbols have come from god
the somewhere deeper than the most dramatic
example this shift understanding has been the treatment
the sacred species consecrated host and with pita
bread common come away from the altar with hands covered
the host sign this isnt and but
catholics the past would have been distraught this real
desacration the real symbol
modern catholic liturgy caught this epistemological
try perfrom the old but then have some liturgomaniac
priest get and what are doing stop doing and
start pretending this not soul filling
help btw that have got stuck witha huge amount two and
three chord music result complicated
tunes are fact easier remember than simple ones this was the
genius wesley and the anglican hymn only
slightly
what are well suggest rejecting the parish system
work for search out church where the liturgy well
prepared not they exist every this not btw
matter particular the music might old
the attitude the church that note that conservative
liturgy harking back does not necessarily mean
the church will socially
nyc can

there certain truth this only would use the word
instead with regard the condition the human
christianity first and foremost healing also
strengthens and enables healing takes grow new
strength and health live and and that for which god created
some people use drugs escape from
rightly allowed brings one nearer
reality and offers the clarity understanding and the strength
spirit with which meet healthy human
christians inject themselves with jesus and live with that

	larry overacker responding
may interesting see some brief selections posted the
understanding that sspx does not consider itself
schism legitimately but really beside
the what does the roman catholic church
excommunication can real apart from formal
provided for canon
some the theology involved for the
there confusion over this issue the often the
basic problem lack ability distinguish
true obedience
false obedience
disobedience
schism
take the various classifications obedience there are
important elements involved here for
command
the response made the command
far the command commands can such the
pope ordering catholics not eat meat they can
such the pope ordering catholics worship the god
dagon when every other full moon comes
far the response command can refuse
what
making there are thus
command response name
legitimate comply true obedience
illegitimate refuse true obedience
legitimate refuse disobedience
illegitimate comply false obedience
now you see where classifications obedience come
obedience not solely matter the nature
the commands must also taken into not enough
consider compliance refusal and then say whether they are
you also have take into consideration
whether the commands are good
the pope commands all catholics worship the god
and they all they being disobedient
far the society saint pius they are certainly
refusing comply with certain things the pope but that
alone insufficient allow one label them you
also have consider the nature the papal
and the sspx says the popes since vatican have been
commanding certain very bad things for the the popes have
course
where are are another arian complete with weak
are the sspx priests modern martin the only
way answer that examine who saying and what the
traditional teaching the church
the problem here that very few catholics have much idea
what really going and what the issues the religion
american catholics especially defective intellectual you
will never read about the issues being discussed the catholic press
this the other one italian catholic magazine
get days has had interviews with the superior general the
society saint pius
many catholics will decide side with the there some
soundness because the papacy eventually
some pope straighten all this the other
there also unsoundness the short the
popes may indeed and such catholics are doing nothing
help the situation obeying them where
the situation grave they sin obeying the very
wasting great because they are failing
love christ heroic way the very time that needs this
move what
schism superset disobedience obey legitimate
all schismatics are but
work the other way not all disobeyers are
the mere fact that the sspx priests comply with
the holy desires make them
what that must added disobedience constitute
maybe this something else makes the sspx priests
you must add the rejection the right look any
decent reference catholic and what
the distinguishing criterion schism rejection the right
what the catholic encyclopedia for
not every disobedience order possess this
character must include besides the trangression the commands
denial their divine right
the article
the society saint pius then the answer clear
they say that the pope their they pray for him every
and all that matters far schism
what all this boils down leave aside the
consideration the exact nature their their position
legitimate far the catholic theology obedience and
schism they are resisting certain papal policies because they
think that they are clearly contrary the traditional teaching
the and the best interests the someone
who finds himself this situation has
what the stance rome all you read the
holy motu proprio you can find the
definitive document the motu proprio specifically
papal not the product roman letter
that the pope has possibly never even from the pope
his boss one else complain
this the holy father among other
the episcopal consecrations performed archbishop lefebvre
constituted schismatic
archbishop problem was misunderstanding the nature
both are fail see the logic the
far the episcopal consecrations read interesting
article translation the italian magazine
all gets back the question episcopal
consecrations imply rejection the then they
would truly constitute schismatic justifying excommunication
under the current code canon but problem with this
according the traditional theology holy episcopal
consecration does not confer only confers the power
the ability confect the jurisdiction must
conferred someone else with the power confer the
the society knowing the traditional theology quite
take great pains avoid any pretence jurisdiction over
they simply confer those sacraments that require
the article was interesting that posited that the
reason that the pope said what did that has
idea holy according this
episcopal consecration confer lent the article
tell you believe they
quoted the new code canon law support this
the thinking this point remains great puzzle
way there according traditional catholic
why does the pope think
far the points regarding the nature tradition
the passage
the root this schismatic act can discerned incomplete
and contradictory notion because does
not take sufficiently into the account the living character
the second vatican council clearly
comes from the apostles and progresses the church with the
help the holy there growth insight into
the realities and words that are being passed this comes
about various comes through the contemplation and
study believers who ponder these things their
comes from the intimate sense spiritual realities which
they and comes from the preaching those who
have along with their right succession the
the sure charism
but especially contradictory notion tradition which
opposes the universal magisterium the church possessed the
bishop rome and the body impossible
remain faithful the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond
with him the person the apostle christ
himself entrusted the ministry unity his
motu proprio july
seems that the holy father making two points here that can
simplified the
vatican council has
the
the argument being that either case sufficient prove that
archbishop lefebvre must because disagrees with
this say the
would have helped clarify things more the pope had addressed
archbishop concerns what john paul
stand the social kingship taught gregory pius
leo pius and pius for are supposed
ignore what all these popes said the
know what the future will but the powers that the
sspx are still talking with rome and trying straighten things
people would prefer call justified refusal obey
even god rather than
calling refusal obey obedience puts into sort alice
wonderland world where words mean whatever want them
schism indicates formal break the the pope
says that schism seems that definition
may that the pope the wrong side the
that there good reason for the break and that will
shortly but how can one deny that does fact
seems that you are grave danger destroying the thing
you are trying the power the what good will
you you become reconciled the the pope the but
the you have destroyed his ability use the tools church
one thing hold that the pope has misused his
and excommunicated someone something else
say that his excommunication did not take and the schism
all his that means that acts church discipline are
not legal but acts whose validity open generally
has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the
while they have often objected church generally they
have admitted that the sanctions you are now opening the door
people simply ignoring papal claiming truly
obeying and communion while
this would seem precisely the denial divine right command
that you say defines

	looking through files this ran across some lyrics from
various rock groups that have here are two from black
say this much for the music the and early
least they asked questions jethro tull another
asked and wrote about things that caused one
interesting that you posted those because just the
other day was thinking doing the like those
since whenever approached
evangelical fundamentalists who throw the bible because
have long wear black leather and listen black
have something throw usually their chins drop
and they come speechless over those not very satanic
just goes show that there are more important evils the
world battle than rock

tammy
	new this and also fairly new was
raised unitarian and have spent the better part life
but recently have developed the firm conviction that the
christian message correct and have accepted jesus into
but realize very ignorant about much the bible and
quite possibly about what christians should hold this trying
rectify reading the bible but would helpful
also read good the bible other
relevant aspects the christian one questions would
like ask can anyone recommend good reading list theological
works intended for lay
have another question would like not yet affiliated
with any one aside from matters what criteria
should one use choosing really know the difference
between the various protestant
thanks for reading
steve hoskins
from you might also want consider
these are books intended for use undergraduate bible
they give historical discussion literary
and generally they have good bibligraphies for further
typically recommend froehlich and
there are also some good they
often have background articles that are probably the best
recommendation these days would bible
think there may couple books with this this
fairly recent like about done cooperation with the
society for biblical you are committed
you will probably prefer something more read
lot conservative but commentary looked donald
guthrie looked rather has and also
editor bible
	appreciate anyone can point out some good books about the dead sea
scrolls thanks
	despite feminist tendencies and the fact
that basically agree with what you are saying will
for all those people who insist question
authorities sometimes tell people evil people who
follow have tortured and killed others very large
and protest their innocence
the basic question here know what supposed
this true every situation that comes some people not
think about all and merely follow their claim
that just dangerous could site
sexually transmitted drug all manner criminal
the savings and loan car eggs thrown
all are examples people not
could easily argue that the evil examples you gave the
problem was leader not following authority and doing what
where the top the therein lies
our
when your authority starts telling you you should ask
except for situations pressing need said shut the
hatch because the submarine filling with any reasonable
authority should able give least some justification that you
can
think simple you are
should recycle
realize that have four kids despite being very precocious
are very tiring with their constant lack understanding
the tremendous knowledge wish impart
just sure listen when authority
ironic
the irony was implying initial pithy retort the bumper
sticker cliche was that was questioning
the authority the person telling question
seems there certain segment society that finds meaning
only being only forsaking everything
for the sake question their integrity and
there another freedom that comes from doing task
different people are different levels development different
part the challenge life find the right authorities
know everything about often
when learning new skill subject will follow the
perhaps only when have learned enough ask appropriate
questions should question only when have developed
skills enough should challenge once how know
when get those
you have told question perhaps you

old lazarus but going the tomb was part initiation

read that but another one smith which similar
claims were made about while sure smith knows more about
early chrisitanity than found his arguments similar those
books like holy building conjectures top
other there was direct like
summarize the argument for happy see but
doing like you pay careful attention the nature
the
	commited christian that battling with know
romans talks about how are saved our faith not our yet
and james say that faith without deeds you
you still think that just believing
some deleted
the opinion that you saved through faith alone what you
taught but how can square mind the teachings james
conjunction with the lukewarm christian being
anyone help this really bothers
dear
never replied this thing before hope gets thru
had few
its not accompanied action james
faith both belief and
say that great swimmer but never really
and will people believe that
likewise say christian but never talk really
faith demonstrated the fact that talk
god proves have satan believes god but does not follow
similar have recently been challenged
says know that have come know him obey his
find this verse quite encouraging could imply that have
come know then obey his cos lives within and
cannot help but obey what

	hello are doing bible study
have been doing pretty good far getting some sort reasonable
are now chapters and which talk about the
woman the beast and the fall believe the beast the
antichrist may differ but seems and the woman represents
babylon which stands for rome the roman catholic what are some
views this the falling babylon chapter the same
babylon chapter the catholic
hate step
thanks
interesting interpretation revelation and has been given
evangelist david not saying that totally agree with his
but certainly believable and good food for
interprets the babylon revelation being none other than the good
old supports his claim several
the babylon revelation the world leader trade and and the
whole world wept when babylon the american despite the japanese
success the still the most sought after currency the
the were the whole world the bible
also talks about babylon being home and adultery
sin should
the whole take much looking see that the
state moral the american culture and hollywood spread the
feels mentality all over the that what
wilkerson uses his strongest argument the fact that revelation calls
babylon the and portrays the most powerful nation
matter how dissatisfied you are with the state our
think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the still the
most powerful nation
this interpretation not necessarily but find worthy
jeffrey little
	have come across what consider excellent
bit lengthy for but thought share with all you
feel free pass along anyone whom you feel might
benefit from what may god richly bless those who read
what kind question anyone who can read sees
and bumper stickers that loves
that
true that god offers his love the whole read
one the most quoted verses the
for god loved the that gave his only begotten
that whosoever believeth him should not but
have everlasting john
love the bible
the way the wicked abomination unto the but
loveth him that followeth after proverbs
for the lord knoweth the way the but the way
the ungodly shall psalm
but not moral surely the good
have done life far outweighs whatever bad have how
can these verses apply
standard righteousness even the most moral person
looked upon god desperate sinner his way the
bible teaches that one good enough himself
the are all sinners and are all guilty before
there none not there
none that there none that seeketh after
romans
the heart deceitful above all and desperately
who can know jeremiah
such wicked person what will god
the bible teaches that the end the world all the wicked will
come under eternal punishment place called
for fire kindled mine and shall burn unto the
lowest and shall consume the earth with her
and set fire the foundations the will heap
mischiefs upon will spend mine arrows upon they
shall burnt with and devoured with burning
and with bitter will also send the teeth
beasts upon with the poison serpents the
deuteronomy
come hell not surely things are not
that
hell very and things are that bad for the
ual who does not know the lord jesus christ the bible
makes many references indicating that both eternal
and consists perpetual
and whosoever was not found written the book life was
cast into the lake revelation
shall the end the the angels shall come
and sever the wicked from among the and shall
cast them into the furnace there shall wailing and
gnashing matthew
when the lord jesus shall revealed from heaven with
his mighty flaming fire taking vengeance them
that know not and that obey not the gospel our lord
jesus who shall punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence the and from the glory
his thessalonians
that why would god create
hell and exists because god created man
accountable god for his perfect justice demands
payment for
for the wages sin romans
for must all appear before the judgment seat
that every one may receive the things done his
according that hath whether good
corinthians
but say unto that every idle word that men shall
they shall give account thereof the day
matthew
does that mean that the end the world everyone will brought
life again judged and then sent
indeed that unless can find someone our
substitute bearing the punishment eternal damnation for our
that someone god who came earth jesus
christ bear the wrath god for all who believe
all like sheep have gone have turned every one
his own and the lord hath laid him the iniquity
isaiah
but was wounded for our was bruised for
our the chastisement our peace was upon
and with his stripes are isaiah
for delivered unto you first all that which also
how that christ died for our sins according the
and that was and that rose again the
third day according the corinthians
for hath made him sin for who knew that
might made the righteousness god
corinthians
are you saying that trust christ who was
already punished for then will not have worry about
hell
this have believed christ then
have already stood before the judgment throne
christ substitute has already paid for
that believeth the son hath everlasting and
that believeth not the son shall not see but the wrath
god abideth john
but what does mean believe agree with all that
the bible says about christ then saved from going
believing christ means whole lot more than agreeing our
minds with the truths the means that hang our whole
lives means that entrust every part our lives
the truths the means that turn away from our sins
and serve christ our
man can serve two for either will hate the
and love the else will hold the and
despise the cannot serve god and
matthew
repent and that your sins may
blotted when the times refreshing shall come from the
presence the acts
are you saying that there other way escape hell except
through what about all the other will their
followers also
they cannot escape the fact that god holds
able for our god demands that pay for our other
religions cannot provide substitute bear the sins their
christ the only one who able bear our guilt and
save
neither there salvation any for there none
other name under heaven given among whereby must
acts
jesus
the the and the man cometh unto the
but john
confess our faithful and just forgive
our and cleanse from all
john
now not want what can
you must remember that god the only one who can help you
must throw yourself altogether the mercies you see
your hopeless condition cry out god save
and the standing afar would not lift much
his eyes unto but smote upon his
god merciful luke
what must and they believe
the lord jesus and thou shalt
acts
but how can believe christ know little about
god not only saves through the lord but
also gives the faith believe you can pray god that
will give you faith jesus christ your
for grace are saved through and that not
the gift ephesians
god works particularly through the bible give that
you really mean business with god about your you
should use every opportunity hear and study the which
the only word
this all verses from the bible are within indented
give heed them with all your
then faith cometh and hearing the word
romans
but does this mean that have surrender everything
god wants come him total acknowledging
our sinfulness and our trusting totally
the sacrifices god are broken broken and
contrite thou wilt not psalm
because are sinners love our must begin
pray god for intense hatred our and
sincerely desire will also begin turn from our sins
god strengthens know that our sins are sending
unto you first having raised his son sent him
bless turning away every one you from his
acts
the bible teach that must attend church regularly and
will these save
should these but they will not save
work any kind can secure our salvation
sovereign gift grace given according his mercy and good
salvation
not lest any man should ephesians
what else will happen the end the
those who have trusted jesus their savior will transformed
into their glorious eternal bodies and will with christ
for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with
with the voice the and with the trump
and the dead christ shall rise then which are
alive and remain shall caught together with them the
meet the lord the and shall ever
with the thessalonians
what will happen the earth that
god will destroy the entire universe fire and create new heavens
and new earth where christ will reign with his believers

lord will come thief the night for the will not

approved our church worthy happened
the moral lesson the story
the lamb god has been sacrificed and his blood has
been used cleanse our sins every moment god perceives
worthy being done mary weeps for the lamb and
for the rest her this will continue while
disobey god sin against
has been given the task make the evil
serpent disobedience
running after the rest her
the children who went astray disobedience led the dragon
brought back her peace and loving reparations for

she was conceived without sin worthy bearing the

protected from the she has been preparing the new
reversing the deed the ancient the new eden will

relate the story
believe this and one her apparitions
she appeared these
two children who tends goats and cows forgot
the exact she was weeping and telling the
children that she afraid lose her
she mourning too for these
townfolks because was their fault that there
would drought their not much good
food again this year was last
mary tells the
most the townfolks this place worked whole
week even sundays when they should church
honoring these townfolks swears and
uses her name bad that
why her arm heavy
then she asked them they the children
said she asked them pray every
morning and when the children went back
from work they had tell somebody about

	all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer either these questions then perhaps you can
how you determine which parts scripture are and
truths are
the answer both questions
perhaps have different definitions absolute
absolute something that constant across
true every instance you agree
with this think you
all truth truth
contradiction when something when always
not always then have
contradiction
simple
the new testament have bible and
provide women are instructed silent and cover
their heads this your
this truth and therefore
women your church they cover their all
scripture absolute seems that women speaking and
coming church with bare heads should intolerable
women speak evangelical churches and come with bare
least this was the case the evangelical churches grew
evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part scripture
absolute there are plenty other
can you reconcile
many people claim that there are absolutes the such
statement terribly let put you this
there are conclude that the
are not absolutely have
contradiction
claim that there are think there are very
and determining absolutes
this just one the reasons why christians defy the world claiming
that there are indeed absolutes the
hardly even evangelical
mention the rest regarding
people sometimes disagree about what this does not negate
the that there are still absolutes the
but you are claiming that all scripture how can you
determine absolutes derived from scripture when you agree how
interpret the
very difficult see how you can claim something which based
your own you deny that your own
come into play when you read the
and determine how interpret you deny that
you fact

	may really dumb but ask
christians know that they can never live the requirements
may but that but they still
seem like are spending all our lives
reach goal can never know that are saved
and not but does that mean that once are saved

the essence marriage two commitment each
two people claim married their but are not
willing have the marriage recognized church and
prima facie evidence that the commitment really
there are obvious situations which christian marriage possible
without civil church stranded desert
your state forbids the marriage for unjust reason
laws against interracial
the legal concept meant ensure that
the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the
usual ceremony and
concerned that people should not use married
excuse for living together without formal
one has duty have marriage properly recorded and
but there are also people who have been through wedding ceremony
without making genuine and therefore are not married
michael associate research scientist

think the last statement believe long
someone has formally undertaken the responsibility they
have moral even their intention was not other
people are involved the marriage they believed
good faith that marriage then think there are
obligations created course there are situations where
intent can cause marriage not the classic example when
done part but these are and should
clear all
	have another question would like not yet affiliated
with any one aside from matters what criteria
should one use choosing really know the difference
between the various protestant
here america people tend think choosing church much like they
think choosing car country what mean that our
culture such that tend towards satisfying our own wants rather
than considering things with others mind and not making prayer
initial and primary part the decision people tend
treat church they would club and when something less than
their off they another
think that scripture presents the idea that god takes different
perspective the choosing seems from
that god subscribe the idea choosing church all
but that places the body wants think better
question not how choose church but how figure out where
god trying place
person was instrumental leading you the church they
logical first you have been born into the family
people should hop around from church church often they
hop from natural family
you met the lord your own there may not
easily identifiable church try for here you are more
like prayerfully and yourself few
and see anyplace feels like
expect that god want place you church where you
have difficulty fitting with the but the other hand
there are perfect you have attitude looking
for problems you will both find them and make the other hand
you have attitude love and you will spread that
wherever you
think that god will try place you church that
talks about the lord the way that you have come know him and
expanding that

all these they may provide valid evidence for

some that they may spiritually this

are right that science and reason cannot prove
not use them can only then believe faith and since
can only use why one picture any less

have not opposed simply new source

have many systems for explaining the evidence the physical and

must now establish reasons for not believing this true based the

knowledge could made isolating the study physical
interactions for the more general areas study and proceeding
not logical argument but the scientific method
attempt disprove the you
others fail disprove your accept
working theory and move this method suitable only
for the study objects without objects which not
take interest the
science does not progress via experimentation but one
aim experiments investigate the validity the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced this thinking
the arrogance science the assumption many advocates
science make that the scientific method the only method
serious the only one leading knowledge rather than
science has one advantage all other approaches explaining the
its further the assumption which arises
since science the only valid method everything
which exists must the sort thing which the scientific
method can and that the scientific method cannot
study either does not exist cannot any way
anything which affects the physical world can for
since are part the physical anything which
affects our behaviour can science does not make any claims
about the existence objects which not affect the

since these asumptions about the nature the world cannot

believe well and just plain
sloppy
the purpose science produce model the the
model must able explain all past observations and predict the outcome
future one the aims experiments carry out
well defined observations which are
ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the and
the model which realises the minimal number the
moment models which not rely the assumption some world
existing are equally powerful ones which assume the assumption

	are you christian
why are you using paul correct the words
doubt mind about what sin and what
least not this jesus did not deal explicitly with
question whether the law was binding
who dissolves even one the smallest commands and teaches
others the same will known the lowest the kingdom the
whereas who keeps the commands and teaches them will
known great the kingdom the
are you are you
why not that since jesus say that his words apply only
that they apply all human irregardless race
why not that even though jesus did not mention your still
jesus was talking directly
why
cite evidence such the way jesus dealt with the
general jewish views dependent largely studies
pauline one and one whose author
with the both authors are various
and jews have discussed the issue here and
clear that the law still does not say that
applies
does say that applies are you anyone
say that the specific requirement for worship the
the ten commandments ceremonial when
the obligations
remember the sabbath day and keep six days you
shall labor and all your but the seventh day sabbath
the lord your you shall not any work your son
your male female your the stranger who
within your for six days the lord made heaven and
earth and and all that and rested the seventh
therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hollowed
there specific requirement for worship however for
one would not bold call these verses
many christians still practice
not sure quite what else can say this
the jesus answer the question
unfortunate that jesus use your name maybe
jesus are you somebody
know what the jewish approach how jesus
with least one and how disciples dealt
the issue when became more acute referring acts
than given that these are all see
big
you see then perhaps there paul closes

but evil for the person who eats offensive

least this there must causal
reasonable alternative
would argue that causality actually property
causes precede their but you claim that there must
answer did the universe emerge from
science has some good candidates for
have always wondered why christians use the are questions
science cannot hope this the
appropriate group ask this
the most popular question the question why does the
universe for that
think this question should actually split into two namely
why there why anything
and
how did the universe emerge from
clear science has nothing say about the first
meaningful after
would say consider the
skeptic being human attempts doubt
very since easy doubt everything else
cannot the world may mind fooling
can ever sure
only possible exist not
insert appropriate shakespeare quote here
being that does not exist cannot doubt
being that does exist can doubt but this would
pointless the being would exist
let return the original being that does not
exist does not need any reasons for its this being
not whether anything else exists but his but let
assume that the world exists independent the mind objectivity
the question anything can countered
demanding answer question there nothing
both questions turn out
devoid things that exist and things that exist
tautology its
seriously doubt god could have answer this
some christians have talked have said that god
himself the see several problems with this
inevitably leads the conclusion that god
actually good and devils and and
this not
another answer that god the all
this sounds much but tempted does god
himself god the source his own
can only mean that terms human always
but this not the same the source all
this argument sounds like god does not but
and from his created
think this actually mere twist
the best answer have heard that human reasoning incapable
understanding such being atheist not
accept such since not have any other
the second how did the universe emerge from
belongs the domain and for not doubt the
question can answered its many cosmologists have
suggested that entirely possible for universes emerge
from vacuum possibility has been suggested recent
hawking see also lizhi creation the
world think the sci groups are more
appropriate for discussions like
far can the very laws nature demand that
true something outside nature
this not science collection models telling
not something cannot see any good reason why the
questions would bound only natural assuming that the
supernatural domain supernatural beings
appropriate ask why they ask why

now this getting
was raised roman catholic before becoming have stated
this creed you quote nearly every sunday until was about for some
always took the this statement mean the
resurrection the but guess resurrection does strictly mean
the raising the physical have some questions this
always thought that christians believe the descent into hell was
pretty much and that there are people burning hell right
you seem implying that will not occur until after the
read meaning the proverbial judgment
was always little confused this even when was with the
church maybe someone can clear for where will
the believe exist until that
will the new body will have created out the same atoms
that body now made will built from
physical body now susceptible guess
new body will have radically different order immortal

some believe that people until the final
resurrection because god above pass directly from death

that souls have existence until
there are probably other alternatives that
the new body generally conceived being implemented
different than the current one which not
talks about the mortal being raised and
resurrected body which the first example clearly was not
subject the same kind limitations assumed that
there are enough similarities that people will recognize each

some there was excellent discussion

escape your
the correct word there way sure our models and
theories are absolutely theories are backed
but not proved theory can mathematical
theories are not mere descriptions rationalisations
extremely important test whether theories can
something new not yet all successful theories

does not mean they but they are not mere

but you claim that there must
answer did the universe emerge from
science has some good candidates for
all which require something christians readily admit
you want this not what science
requires take good look the theory and the see
the theory has made any successful and use your
disbelievers are not
the fact that there are several candidates belies that are
with out conclusive are left with
this what puzzles why need have faith
fellow atheists would call weak atheist someone who
unable fails entertain any belief
know that one believe without luther makes
this quite clear his letter afraid this does not
change
couple paragraphs ask does the
universe
think this question should actually split into two namely
why there why anything
and
how did the universe emerge from
the question anything can countered
demanding answer question there nothing
both questions turn out
devoid things that exist and things that exist
tautology its
carefully examine the original and then the
the first asks while the second request for
although does look like this true
either something nothing nothing nobody
would ask something possible ask but
actually existing being could give
for that the nobodies could also
nothing this equivalent
nothing exists
anything equivalent something exists
what meant with apologies
for the poor wording previous
might the worldview that exist and things that
grounded the realm the
does the belief based the assumption
that there reason for something ultimately
the position there being its very
foundation exists the same soil that one who claims there
indeed think there probably reason for
for reasons stated they will still
leave open the question and not and this where
theistic explanations come
science cannot give reasons for any human
come either therefore for
this deep philosophical question determinism
god deterministic tend think this question has
meaning his
for yet failed see what would
from our looks like exist for truly random
just rolled two dice why did get and how can
believe there any better reason for
the former satisfactory then you are for you are
and need not the your search just
satisfied with this until find something
years christianity were help this have
but
another answer that god the all
this sounds much but tempted does god
himself god the source his own
can only mean that terms human always
but this not the same the source all
this does not preclude his only seeks identify his
exists
but think existing god cannot know why
for answer this question not this
should not any obstacle belief his
also have discovered science inadequate tool answer
appears that pihko agrees shall but because tool
inadequate answer question does not preclude the asserting
that invalid question does not provide
impossible know unknowable the question
invalid question this
not what but from our impossible
and just believe any given explanation instead
especially since found was deluding
was using why did this come why did
become why did become
think there time
this spacetime some other and from that
our universe never exists only for those who
are inside
but come the admission that science fails answer because
answered the realm modern does that make the
question
the validity the question has discussed think
philosophy great help what can and what not
pihko does present good point may need ask
individual christian base faith will shaken the
production evidence that shatters our will seek

not not john the though but the son

there hell then jesus preached was our lord
not some angry baptist that the worm never and
where the fire never goes jesus said was jesus who called hell
was jesus that used the

andy byler
	regarding our moderator
may some misunderstanding over terms
quite
believe
originally was the context these are folks who
believe that baptism should done with formula mentioning only
rather than and holy this may have
doctrinal but far know does not mean that
these folks deny the existence divinity the not the
right one describe this and fact think there may
including what would classically called monophysite
arian rather different well some who have beliefs
that are probably consistent with trinitarian but who
use trinitarian language because they misunderstand simply
because not
not what then can they make the end
jesus came and said authority heaven and
earth has been given therefore and make disciples all
baptizing them the name the father and the son and
the holy and teaching them obey everything that
have commanded and with you the end
the ancient authorities add
the notes give sense that this other texts
contradict this regarding misunderstanding the
trinity the most likely explanation after
but maybe simply misunderstand their anyone else out there
forced read this group with both good bible and unabridged
christianity really education
when talked about people who rejected trinitarian
language was speaking trinitarian things
like essense and three obviously the
baptismal formula you point normally use the
term referring while certainly
consistent with belief the the trinity doctrine whose
full formulation occurred the and unlikely
that had mind the trinitarian
indeed the baptismal formula used some groups that
not believe the the disagreement over baptismal formulae
occurs because passages such acts which command baptism
the name are couple other passages acts
this leaves with sort commanded
baptize the name the the and the holy
and acts baptize the name
groups baptize the name they consider this
consistent with mat because they say that jesus the name
the the and the holy not the right one
ask explain what this will simply say that does not
appear normal trinitarian also odd way
dealing with the idiomatic phrase the name
those who use the formula seem have standard
answer the passages talking about baptizing the name
suspect that the most common explanation say that the name
need not verbal say that you baptize the name
jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under
the contrasts christian baptism
with the baptism john other jewish course
certain parallelism between these that suggests that
could just well say that mat require the specific
formula used but simply characterizes
baptism done those who follow the and holy
one might well suspect that the early more than one
baptismal formula was long consider following jesus
the same following the and holy great
damage would done such this does mean that
think should back using both baptism one
the few things that almost all christian groups now recognize
not think doing something upset that would
the interests the this reinforced the fact that
those groups that actually use the name now seem
have mind difference but said
not the one explain what their doctrine

again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox
churches believe monophysitism pops had discussion
about while
proper term for what mike expresses this was
that was condemned the council chalcedon
reaction which held that the son and jesus
two different people who happened united the same body
monophysitism held the copts egypt and ethipoia
the jacobites syria and the armenian
then ofm comments
issues get mighty when you see people saying different
often hard tell whether they really mean seriously
whether they are using different
think any question that there problem with
and would agree that the saying christ had human form
real human nature will but like
bit wary about the recent discussions
that their monophysite position may not far from
many had
with appreciation the believe that further elaboration
this excerpt from article featured the first issue
the newsletter
under the authority the eastern roman empire constantinople opposed
the western empire the patriarchs and popes alexandria played
leading roles christian they were invited everywhere speak
about the christian pope was the head the
ecumenical council which was held ephesus the year was said
that the bishops the church alexandria did nothing but spend all their
time this leading did not fare well when politics
started intermingle with church all started when the emperor
marcianus interfered with matters faith the the response
the pope alexandria who was later this interference
was have nothing with the these political motives
became even more apparent chalcedon when the coptic church was
unfairly accused following the teachings who believed
this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only
one the not two the human well the
the coptic church has never believed monophysitism the way was
portrayed the council that monophysitism meant
believing one copts believe that the lord perfect his
and perfect his but his divinity and his
humanity were united one nature called nature the incarnate
which was reiterated cyril believe two
natures and that are united one
without and without the declaration faith
the end the coptic divine these two natures not separate
for moment the twinkling from the declaration faith
the end the coptic divine
the coptic church was misunderstood the century the council
perhaps the council understood the church but they
wanted exile the isolate and abolish the
independent despite all the coptic church has remained very
strict and steadfast its whether was conspiracy from the
western churches exile the coptic church punishment for its refusal
politically whether pope dioscurus quite the
extra mile make the point that copts are not the coptic
church has always felt mandate reconcile differences between
all christian this aptly expressed the current
successor pope shenouda the coptic faith

terminology are little importance throughout this the
coptic church has played important role the ecumenical the

andrew byler correctly stated the nestorians and monophysites were
actually opposite the point was which nabil
explains some that some groups that have been considered
heretical probably
chalcedon was compromise between two the alexandrians and
adopted language that was intended acceptable
moderates both while ruling out the agree
that there were extremes that were however the course
the complex politics the appears that some people got
rejected who intend but simply used language that was
not understood even was and some seem not have
jointed the compromise for reasons other than there are
groups descended from both the supposedly heretical this
posting discussed the descendants the there are also
remaining like some the current
there reason believe that the current
nestorians are not heretical they sheltered nestorius from
what they saw unfair but claim they did not adopt his
and fact seem follow more moderate representatives

ludwig wittgenstein
now ludwig was desciple fame often
explained the fact that spawned not one but two significant movements
contemporary both revolve around tractatus
and philosophical investigation many comments and
implicit conclusions suggest ways going beyond the explicit critique
language according some the implicit suggestions
ordinary language invaluable offering necessary
framework for the conduct daily though its formal features
remain the its content does not and always capable being
transcended our experience changes and our understanding giving
clearer picture what are and what wish own
there dynamic fluidity for this reason that
any critique language must move from talking about the limits language
talking about its where boundary understood not wall but
comment that have content that often lies
deep beneath the surface the witt talks the
insuperable position ordinary language and the necessity bringing
ourselves accept without the same are faced with
own creative uses language and his concern for bringing about changes
our traditional modes through more
perspicacious seeks effect this unity rather than assuming that
already the most brilliant scientists are unable
offer foundation for human speech long they reject his
tractatus have the well nigh perfect exhibition the nature the impasse
the scientific ideal exhaustive logical analysis reality
perfect language does not exist for fallen therefore must get about
our buisness relating truth via ordinary
this why gospel dear most simple
conveyance the revealation yet full unlieing depth
viewed christ from the concept man
john looked the outward only indicator what was
that the consciousness and must words are only vehicals
the scriptures are plain their expounding that
there truth and that there are and they too
are they are only knowable when reveals them the
there and shy from mysticism
paul rom says there are men the there the
one who does not have the spirit and therefore can not know the things the
spirit spirit and there the one who has the spirit and has
the capacity know the but there the the one who not
only has the but that the spirit has who can know the deep things
god and reveal them other than the and only the deep
things god that are absolute and

	the suggestion that all prophecy tends somewhat
you not exactly sure what you how does the
relate prophecy the birth christ
see any cycles that
maybe cyclical not the best
another example would the scripture quoted his bishoprick
let another another example something that isaiah said his
disciples which also applied christ children thou
hast given
how does the preterist view account for this
first all would say that not sure all
the prophecies had the isaiah
would say that just because this happens some occasions does not mean
will occur especially with regard the apostles
who quoted the and applied those passages jesus were acting divine
messengers and giving the inerrant word god the one has
that authority one has the apostolic authority say that
prophecy has the imagry
revelation fits with events the folly for try
and make apply events centuries

that happened less than year later the bolshevik
she also predicted the second world war that would occur during the papacy certain who

reddish color the sky ever this day some try
explain off the northern and the relation
prediction simply you all can decide for
mary predicted that the atheistic russia would spread her evils all
over the world and persecute
she said many other things too numerous list every

	the words mean anything
defy any theist
despite what mother told about accepting here
you have very careful about what you mean
taken that which authoratative
and say question word this
open the other perfectly
reasonable question whether something the catch phrase
here should once you have authenticated
your you must believe what you are not treating
the difficulty that authenticating authority not you
can perhaps discredit claim authority showing logical inconsistency
what showing that does not obey its own rules
but the fact that cannot discredit something does
accredit does the fact that can convince myself and
other that have discredited something necessarilly mean that
cannot accredit authority independantly verifying its
because can independantly verify its need
need authority only when there information need which
cannot get for authenticate must
some means other than examining its
practical matters accept all kinds authorities because
have time rediscover fundamental knowledge for every scientist
woring today the authority the scintific all sorts
knowledge which necessary his work but which has not time
verify for
spiritual accept authority because have direct source
select our authorities based various
because the historical claims the church seem
the without authorities there would subject matter for
unless simply made something for ourselves many
the atheist position seems that there are this
reasonable assertion but leads practical
you reject all authority out you reject all possibility

the best known christian prayer begin who art
rather than
they have answers these questions that are even
entertaining queries are left exercise the
may some misunderstanding over terms believe
originally was the context these are folks who
believe that baptism should done with formula mentioning only
rather than and holy this may have
doctrinal but far know does not mean that
these folks deny the existence divinity the not the
right one describe this and fact think there may
including what would classically called monophysite

that are probably consistent with trinitarian but who
use trinitarian language because they misunderstand simply
because not
	earlier explained that what many people find arrogant about
christians that some christians profess absolute certianty about their
beliefs and that many christians insist that they cannot have
made any mistakes when discovering their which amounts saying
that they are
impicitly claiming infallible pretty most will
probably
the problem that matter how good your sources any
part your doctrines beliefs rest your own thinking and
then those doctrines are long your own brain
there possibility for summarised the problem writing
way out the
someone called has claimed that there way out the but
did not bother explain what preferring instead paraphrase
ramble about and say that the conclusion argument
leads
have explained him you cannot reject argument false
because you dislike where the facts not change just because
you dislike
disagree with conclusion because
taken fruition leads relativism which leads
any philosophy student can what has
written does not constitute all has said that does
not like what wrote has done nothing all dispute
there were two sentences post that seemed relevant the
point
there such thing true truth and can
experienced and
not dispute that some truths can verified through
for direct experience adding claim
infallible fact remember doing sums incorrectly but
claim that have direct experience reasoning about
once past experiencing things and start reasoning about
are much shakier that was the point the earlier
human brains are infested with and they can only trusted
very limited
only because own revelation that can absolute
about
but how far does that get once revelation and your own
reasoning possibility for error
for suppose that our modern bible translations include
perfect rendering jesus words the last and that jesus
presume that what said was totally without error and absolutely
what can certain not
the moment stops and people start the
possibility error did mean that literally
not have any record that elaborated the was thinking
interpret this passage
using our think and reason and draw but know
that our brains are not our thinking often leads
something that most have direct experience
why should anyone believe that his reasoning which knows
fallible can lead him perfect
given the assumptions this what can certain
that jesus said beyond once start making
doctrines and using our brains reason about what christ
get into
unless you are there are very few things you can certain
the extent that doctrines rely fallible human they
cannot
that the problem seeming the around know
that human beings make just surely know they not
believe are any more than
when christians speak they believe their own reasoning can never lead
them astray when implicitly claim that are infallible the
christians around rarely believe that implicit witnessing
hardly going work when the person you are talking believes that you
are either too foolish recognise your own intentionally trying
cover them
think would far better say what things are certain and what
things are only for might say that
know our for recognising sin something directly but
other whether based reasoning from scripture
should not labled should say that are
very confident and ready explain our
far none infallible speaking acting
our thinking flawless

mark
	think talking about the the blessed virgin
says that immaculate mother the ever virgin
having completed the course her earthly was assumed
and soul into heavenly this was defined papal
though had certainly been believed some
like the immaculate this primarily
catholic and like has direct biblical
note that catholics not believe
they not believe that the bible the only source
thus the fact that doctrine has little
support not necessarily significant they believe
truth can passed through traditions the and also
can revealed the not interested yet
but any catholics can tell
basis for these think would
the there are lot instances where god speaks
where person just some piece
where person walks off into the desert
for with all power certainly can
whatever wants when wants the bible
with the book but does reign end there
who can say for sure that messages are either longer

can now hear the clamor for

that event the

because having heard part cbc radio documentary was that
the rahab woman who sheltered the said that the people were
what with having heard that cbc radio documentary and
knowing that the muslims bosnia were losing the felt
after the serbs are driving
the other ministers say that the bible opposed the values
held our secular anyhow members that church are involved
missionary the pastor has talked spiritual
warfare and bringing christ the nonreligious people our
the next the sermon was about joshua the israelites
take jericho and then proceed massacre everybody there except
for who had sheltered the with those reports about
bosnia felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that
the massacre one was but what really bothered
was was going try taking christianity
troubled about the reports
sympathies with the
considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants christians
under turkish converted islam could the serbs doing
example people setting out bloody wars conquest
has always been troubling discussions personally question
whether they were right even the but those who believe they
were consider that the wars were justified only because they were
specifically commanded somehow see the serbs behaving
like group that led god this

first came with the
this why the most effective

might want provide some evidence next time you make claim
programs alcoholics one the steps
involves acknowleding and other
recovery programs are acknowledged being among the most
evidence for this can dismissed stating
that the same defect personality makes substance abusers makes
people and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
being religious better crutch than being drug but
still maintain that both are suspect that there
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable

working project rebuild the temple the article
included photos the many furnishings that have already been made
preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according the

what was even more striking the fact that the plans for the temple are
complete and the group only awaiting permission from the israeli
government before beginning the the other startling fact the
very recent archeological discovery that the original site the temple
unoccupied and available for previously has been thought that
the original site was underneath what now making rebuilding
impossible without sparking holy

	you ask where would echo that not trying
but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction
and what authority you rely upon for your
what prevents from choosing any doctrine like and saying that
papal disagreement error that will resolved
this especially since councils bishops have basically
stood the
the ultimate question the traditional theology the this
the thing that possible resist pope his
departure from the traditional doctrine the commands
from authority conflict with the commands must
own view this that this conflict could only happen major
god would never allow situation
would too complex for people figure view the
present situation the church anything extremely
run through list what has happened the last years the
catholic and any impartial observer will
appears that much what lies the heart this matter
disagreements over what tradition and and also over
authority and
the problems stem from general widespread ignorance the catholic
most catholics know about zilch about the
catholic this leaves them wide open for destruction erring
basically the reformation part
there not even question mind that some respects the
shards the catholic church are currently being trampled upon the
catholic could listing shocking things for
take the situation for reading book
what happened there after vatican council the antonio
never introduced all the changes that followed the
wake vatican kept the traditional the same old
made sure the people knew their the
catholic theology what modernism
innoculated the people against what was
one day the order came from rome for his came
when the pope was bishop waited until the pope
then inquired whether this command was what the pope really
something that some liberal had commanded his
the pope confirmed the the good bishop
the injustice that followed was completely new bishop
was proceeded expel most bishop
clergy from their because they refused celebrate the new
the new bishop would visit and celebrate new
the people would promptly walk out the church the bishop
was usually resorted enlisting the help
the secular authorities eject the priest from the the
priests would just start building new the people were
completely behind the old parishes had the new the
bishop desired and virtually
the prime motivation for all this was completely according
canon priest can penalized any way for saying the
traditional because legislation enacted pope saint pius
nor there any obligation say the new
during all this the people not just private
but including civil were constantly sending
petitions and letters rome something about the new modernist
nothing was ever help ever arrived from
eventually priests were kicked and about
question the supporters sspx
there any way that your positions with respect church reforms
could change and conformed those the that
the position does not change and that the leaders sspx
jointly make such
this appears claiming infallible teaching
adopt the view that not and
way change you must change that
either left the catholic church has left
the pope defines certain things that would the end
the that process all very well understood
catholic and anyone who along with
instant
the problem here that people not appreciate what going
the catholic they knew the and what our bishops are
they would
sould argue from now until the second coming about what the
traditional teaching the church this were simple matter
east and west would not have been separated for over
this the case the catholic there massive body
traditional the popes the last years are
especially there question all what the traditional
doctrine
thought that the teaching magisterieum the church did not allow
error teachings regarding faith and morals even the short
may wrong not roman
more although they have done great job
since the the last years have seen many errors
spread that
infallibility rests the and the church the
short large sections the church can
what usually happens during major large
sections the church pope historically has been
much more everything will always come back the long
what would the effect pope making cathedra statement
regarding the sspx would how
you get around the formal doctrine
not trying trying
since got real vested interest the
one way the
would infallibility but what
going that the new mass better expression
the catholic faith than the that sex education the catholic
schools that all religions are wonderful except for
that professed the popes prior vatican
does the command was sspx does not view the
commands this very slippery
not start studying the major catholic theologians the last

the writers the are because they set much
the context for the later justin
and theophilus antioch are known the
their theology has often been described
based strongly wording they took more less
through the logos was with the
his mind this became
god revealed himself ultimately
thus full distinction from the father only became visible
though the logos had been present god from
rusch regards this view containing many the emphases the
final orthodox but form which less
because did not have the technical language properly deal with
the eternal plurality the
irenaeus held views somewhat similar the however
was uncomfortable with the still viewed god
one with distinctions that did not become fully visible
except through his process the
distinctions are present his essential irenaeus emphasized
the holy spirit more than the views should
probably called though that term
normally used refer later
third century
dynamic monarchianism
theodotus
paul modern unitarians
perception the unity god denotes both oneness nature
and oneness the son and the holy spirit therefore are
consubstantial with the divine essence only impersonal
the divine dunamis came upon the man but was not god the strict
sense the
perception the notion subsistent god palpable
since his perfect unity perfectly the
god apparent and not since the christ event and the
work the holy spirit attest only dynamic operation within not
hypostatic
asignation
unique originator the and
without beginning
virtuous man whose life god was dynamically present
unique christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was
holy impersonal attribute the deity eternality
ascribed the holy
elevates reason above the witness biblical revelation
concerning the categorically denies the deity christ and the
holy thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical
doctrine
this probably best thought not being trinitarianism
god undifferentiated son and holy spirit are seen
simply names for the man jesus and the grace god active the
modalistic monarchianism
praxeas
united pentecostals
perception the unity god
qualitatively characterized his essence one nature and this
essence may designated interchangeably and holy
they are different names for but identical with the simplex the
three names are the three modes which god reveals
perception the concept subsistent god erroneous
and confounds the real issue the phenomenon modalistic manifesting
the paradox subsisting refuted
recognizing that god not three persons but one person with three different
names and corresponding roles following one another like parts
asignation
fully god and fully eternal the primal mode manifestation
the only unique and unitary god
full ascribed only the sense his being another
mode the one god and identical with his the same god
manifested temporal sequence specific role
holy eternal god only the tile designates the phase which the
one temporal manifested himself pursuant the role
regeneration and
depersonalizes the compensate for its trinitarian
this view propounds ideas that are clearly its
concept successive manifestations the godhead cannot account for such
simultaneous appearances the three persons
comments that evidence these beliefs there are
actually two slightly different groups noetus and his
and noetus was apparently more
sabellius followed and attempted use some features economic
trinitarianism create more sophisticated
information about sabellius comes from century and there
seems some confusion between him and marcellus
moved the following description with the other
originally appeared near the
trinitarianism
tertullian
various trinitarians
perception the godhead characterized
and holy spirit are the three manifestations one
indivisible the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially
comprehended such manifest triadic deeds creation and
perception subsistence within the godhead articulated
means such terms and dispelling
effectively the notion separateness
asignation
the equal deity and holy spirit clearly elucidated
observation the simultaneous features the
does not intelligibly surface this
ambiguous but seems logical
more tentative and ambiguous its treatment the
relational aspect the
that this development the apologists and
mentioned with the threeness visible primarily
the various ways that god revealed himself however they
did say that this manifestation plurality that somehow
present the godhead from the tertullian talks
the and holy spirit being three that are one
many people regard this view being essentially
but with less developed philosophical
developing further approach started attempted
apply christian set many the terms
the coming platonic sees the son
mediating between the absolute one god and the plurality
creating the son but
that the relationship between father and son
cannot said that was once when was
phrase that will haunt the discussion for having the son
intrinsic his concept the father and son are described
separate though this may not have quite the meaning
separate subsistence that had some the union
one love and but there some reason think that may
have used the term homoousios the same the holy
spirit also personal originated the father
through the intent not but
pushes things the direction
fourth century
subordinationism called arianism
arius
major modern and several other lesser known
cults
perception the inherent oneness nature properly
identifiable with the father the son and the holy spirit are discreet
entities who not share the divine
perception the unipersonal essence god precludes the
concept divine subsistence with
contradictory and violates biblical principles monotheistic
asignation
the only unbegotten god who eternal and without
created being and therefore not though
not the divine
holy noneternal emanation the viewed
expression deity not ascribed
variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting
the deity both christ and the holy its hierarchial concept likewise
asserts three essentially separate persons with regard the
and the holy this results totally confused
also that most versions this the son not fully
human supernatural and that distinguishes this
view from
orthodox trinitarianism
athanasius
gregory gregory thomas
contemporary orthodox christianity
perception being perfectly unified and
one this essence deity held common and holy
the three persons are and
perception the divine subsistence said occur
three modes being the godhead exists
divided this view contemplates identity nature and cooperation
function without the denial distinctions persons the
asignation
its final this view unhesitatingly sets forth
and holy spirit and the godhead with regard both
the divine essence and
the only shortcoming has with the limitations inherent
human language and thought the impossibility totally describing the
ineffable mystery
least the there were several different all
which fit the description and all regarded but which
are somewhat different nicea was originally held respond
arius can thought carrying thought bit
too the point making the son separate general
the east tended take approach based and was hard
get acceptance nicea the its final acceptance was
based the work athanasius with the gregory nyssa and

personal faith like not demonstable
objective
choosing what believe and rely are important areas personal
what bothers when others suggest these
matters their specific beliefs are not only true them
but are absolute and should binding follows from this
that god must give everyone the same revelation and thus
anyone who comes different conclusion intentionally choosing
the wrong this the arrogance lack respect for the
honest conclusions others matters which are between them and
even personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs
universalizing those matters personal coupled proud

blind show the glory not because any
other std for sexual what with
diseases like multiple which are just
debilitating and terrible yet are not usually linked
specific behavior
imho forgiveness not the end
still the matter aids
atonement but think missed the mark
about far you can suggesting that aids atonement for
the atonement for sin jesus christ this the central
message the perfect sacrifice was required for our
and was made the lamb his sacrifice atoned for
our past present and god does not require pennance for
our nor does require come with our own
has graciously already done that for suggest that aids
some other consequence atonement for sins literally spitting
the sacrifice that jesus
case you get angry and upset when
see things like instead rationalizing our own fears and
need reaching out people with aids and other
socially unacceptable whether they got the disease through
their own actions not they still need jesus
more and less than said this but think
good people with aids are jesus

other way because belief the resurrection sorry disappoint
the idea resurrection one which can found host different
forms the religions the problem was not the resurrection
which was mediorce issue for tiny fragment the jewish population
but was non issues for everyone the real problem was
that christians were pacifist and preached there was only one when the
state operates system divinitation the emperor monotheism
becomes capital the jews were able get exemption from
and were also not christians were far more and
and hence dangerous and were therefore targets also since
christians were relatively powerless they made good scapegoats
seen blaming them for the burning not cloud the
issues with the
randy
agree with you that christians were not persecuted specifically
because they believed however the beliefs that did
cause trouble were dependent belief the resurrection
course the problem with that there are alternatives other
than great the most common theory among
scholars seems that the resurrection was subjective event
	the have met christians who are not associated with
local church and are not members any local this
issue that may very but what does
bible say about this and how can encourage our friends with
this
this brings interesting subject that has not been discussed
and probably has not been studied
some you may posted lot articles lately
personality typing which the mbti test come
just read ask for
personality type summary
one observation that people have significantly different personalities
question which seem essentially with respect
church attendance and some people thrive while
other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer more
solitary and contemplative lifestyle that they are
confronted with excessive closeness outside activities and lots
course this measured
impression that many churches are totally blind this and
create environments that many who are naturally introverted
are many introverted characters the
quite introverted and find the many churches
meet together large very
knowing what know these churches have been overly
influenced highly extroverted people who thrive this sort
nothing wrong with either extroversion both
preferences have their place the
maybe should define more carefully since these words
are usually not used correctly our the
scale measure how person the following
excerpted from
energizing how person
extroversion preference for drawing energy from the outside
world activities
introversion preference for drawing energy from internal
world
hopefully this will elicit further discussion how churches can
structure themselves meet the real needs the people who comprise
the body instead trying change personalities
fit them into particular sure there are other aspects
how churches have not properly understood personality variances among
their members the detriment

	would like get your opinions when exactly does engaged
couple become some say that the two have
publically announced their plans have made their vows and
are unswervingly committed one another realize this subjective
they are
the way read couple becomes married when they are
when they first have sexual
the end genesis from this man shall
leave his parents and joined his and they will become one
also quotes this scripture referring
you read through genesis you will often come across the
lay with and she became his this
implies that she became his wife when they lay the
point
compare this with jewish when heard that mary
was had mind divorce her quietly but mary and joseph were
not they were binding relationship
required divorce get out but would not occur until mary
and joseph went bed
compare with christ and the church revelation the church
described the but the the lamb takes
place when jesus are binding with
but are still looking forward the time when the marriage will
take see this the spiritual equivalent sexual
because represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and
engagement should honoured binding but
not civil ceremony not marriage marriage occurs the
point when the betrothed couple bed mean demean the
civil church ceremony ours was mean too
think correct stating that the civil ceremony
marriage recognised the has only been around the west since
who introduced keep tabs the people ready
corrected that
this view obviously raises some
what about those who have had sex with one more without considering
are those people also
true that marriage occurs the point necessary
married the eyes the would say because this honours
the laws our nations the although not illegal sleep
together though unmarried most western believe that
honouring proclaim our marriage the state and our friends before
actually consummating our its with our being salt and and
also with how people will perceive culturally insensitive
declare yourself married without going through civil
and hast thou slain the

	the concept god teacher indeed does grade
does that not mention thought
own concept that father and are his
that loves with love that can never understand
until are with the bible says that looks the heart the
final from that grading the heart
the final
most christians would agree that there only one heaven
and one from that heaven you either
one the the basis done god
the father with intervention jesus the not for only
god sees the the bible says the can know
would say there has always and always unchanging
that what makes relationship with christ uncertain
and ever changing landscape always the today and
concerning whether not our childhoods are considerd part
the own conviction were that the case certainly
going the bible speaks very plainly about the
love and care jesus had for and about the reality that
are all some just have bigger bodies and grey but
the our father always like most fathers wants only
the best for his there maybe but there more
sometimes looks like christianity see who makes
and who those who and those who the
other but really much more than
there are few most are just travelers looking for the
light and the way praying that can bring others with
	version the bible you consider the most
knowing greek and probably not picky about translations
would english translations were only source
any verse that comes out substantially different different
lations almost certainly unclear the
very bad practice for translation that fits your own
doctrinal
still like the nrsv and nasv are also very
have strong preference for editions that indent the beginning
each verse verses were the verse numbering

and the two simplest refutations are
what the only record impact comes from the new
have guarantee that its books are the least and that
the recorded actually find interesting that other
contemporary source records temple curtain
being the earliest written claim have resurrection
from the pauline none which were written sooner than years
after the supposed
seems probable that one displayed the body jesus because
one knew where personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen
bother with the point about the guards only appears one
and seems like exactly the sort thing early christians might make
order counter the the new testament does
record that jews believed the body had been there were really
they could not have effectively made this they
	not religious guy dont take this some kinda flame
want know why there are many different versions the there
this version the bible have read about and the front page
inaccurate data and
thanx
not sure quite what you mean many different
the primary distinction versions you see today the style
the pretty unusual see significant
differences there are few differences the underlying
because before manuscripts were copied
slight differences there are enough manuscripts
around that scholars can pretty good job recreating the
but there are some they are
generally the level minor differences there are
something like places where whole sentences are
but with recent discoveries older think
much uncertainly about those far christians
believe that the process copying manuscripts the process
translating free but also think
enough uncertainty establishing the text translating that
has much practical
whether the bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences hot
topic debate many christians deny some accept
most would say that the inaccuracies involved are details
that affect the but this has nothing with there
being multiple the supposed inconsistences can found
all the surprised find reference this the
title page what version are you talking been
referring major scholarly these are what get
referenced postings here and there have certainly been
editions that are less widely this includes
everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into
single editions that omit material that the editor
objects for some reason the the copyright the bible
has long since there nothing stop people from making
editions that whatever wierd thing they however the editions
that are widely used are carefully prepared groups scholars from
variety with lots could imagine
one the editions claiming have fixed all
inaccurate data and but not any edition
widely the widely used ones leave the text
almost been alleged that few
translations have fudged word two here and there minimize
because translation not exact there
are always going differences opinion over which word
	few points about being taken into heaven the end her life
one piece evidence for assumption into heaven the fact
that christian church ever claimed the sight where she was
some christian churches claimed located the final
resting places and other but one ever
claimed possess the body the greatest the
because everyone knew that she had been taken into
although there definitive scriptural proof for the assumption
some passages seem like the passage revelation
that describes woman giving birth son and later being crowned
the the woman this passage has other
she can also taken symbol for the
the assumption mary makes sense because her relationship
perfect god and perfect fulfilled the
requirements the law under the law god gave
are honor our mother and and act taking his
mother into heaven part his fulfillment that
took his flesh from seems appropriate that decide not
allow her flesh rot the
one last attempted explain catholic doctrine
the assumption asserting connected belief that mary
did not this not correct summary what catholics
the dogma the assumption was carefully phrased avoid saying
whether mary did did not the consensus among catholic
theologians seems that mary fact did this would make
christ and his who waited the foot the

the sins were not but rather covered the age the
not only are sins forgiven but the power sin put
this distinction seems quite
blessed the man whose iniquities are whose sin
and quoted the apostle
even david also describeth the blessedness the unto whom god
imputeth righteousness without
blessed are they whose iniquities are and whose sins
are
blessed the man whom the lord will not impute
the biblical perspective seems that foregiveness and covering are
concepts both the dispensational
distinction
during the read that sins are dealt with immediately
the present that christ present rulership
sure rex has scripture back this suggesting jesus
going travel around dealing with individual violations his law for
millions perhaps billions such activity for moses the lawgiver

you are using the standard formula fully god and fully
not sure why you object saying that jesus was
the usual analysis would that sin not part the basic
consequence the jesus
but not fallen
the proper term for what mike expresses this was
heresy that was condemned the council chalcedon
grew reaction which held that the son and jesus
are two different people who happened united the same body
monophysitism held the copts egypt and ethipoia
and the jacobites syria and the armenian believes
that jesus christ was god that was man
that was one person but that had
only one nature and one will and oen energy the
orthodox position that had two natures and two wills and two
both divine and though the wills were perfect
that what mike trying get that while jesus
came human mike says did not have human nature human
had though neither made him subject
original
interesting note that the monothelites were reaction this
conflict and attempted solve the problem admitting two natures but
not two wills two also was late council

issues get mighty when you see people saying different
things often hard tell whether they really mean seriously
different whether they are using different
think any question that there problem with
and would agree that the saying christ had human form
without real human nature will but like
bit wary about the recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not far from
orthodoxy many had nestorius was extreme
representative one the two major schools more
moderate representatives were regarded theodore
impression that the modern monophysite groups
inherit the entire not just and that
some them may have sufficient balanced position regarded

same way mary said enmity with knowing
that jesus christ sinless can conclude that
mary also sinless because she she would not enmity

sinlessness sinlessness would called into
would for god promised enmity between mary and the

	realize very ignorant about much the bible and
quite possibly about what christians should hold this trying
rectify reading the bible but would helpful
also read good the bible other
relevant aspects the christian one questions would
like ask can anyone recommend good reading list theological
works intended for lay
even recommend books from what you ask sounds
attractive but new christian you want
contaminated with other steep your self
and discuss with other read your must but
remember that what other people write their god has
promised give you ask for
have another question would like not yet affiliated
with any one aside from matters what criteria
should one use choosing really know the difference
between the various protestant
wait too long before attaching yourself just remember
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the bereans
darius
	like remind people the withering the fig tree and jesus
driving the money changers out the think those
were two instances christ showing anger part his human
and what about paul
and sin let not the sun down upon your
obviously can angry

abstinence
these figures seem take account woman who
raped considered not have been
longer have the but abstinence was defined something
like contact between the penis and the area
immediately surrounding the and transfer semen the
area surrounding the
that abstinence discussed outside marriage
morally but keep the sperm away from the ovum and conception
the moral question recall the teacher asking
okay create child you able good parent
	brings around asking open the bible closed
okay for around saying told
and told that imply that god still
out new revelation know that some people will feel
and some will the concept closed canon would
cast shadow contemporary the other
open canon seems indicated
get back canon the means
say that rule open then its rule made
there issue also measurement against thus the words
that are spoken need compared against the but not
added the
new revelation personal revelation
say new revelation for all people for all times
not necessary have that
you also seem confuse canon with scripture may speak
itself being open god speaking would speak that
closed the sense that the canon the concept
canon later
interesting note that some called prophecies are nothing new
rather inspired translation right call
that more having with
the gift knowledge may not exciting
but call horse
agree with the problem prophecy meant
exhort correct then overlap with prophecy
meant bring the form man you live with not your
then that yet the exact words their are
would expect the difference the motive and means for
the reading scripture itself can powerful

the notion that the sspx saint pius
that there has been any legitimate
interested reading the truth about this matter please
and send them the document via its pages
wont posting the news
may interesting see some brief selections posted the
understanding that sspx does not consider itself schism
legitimately but really beside the
what does the roman catholic church excommunication can
real apart from formal provided for canon
after all orthodox cinsider ourselves schismatic
but the catholic church considers
this inappropriate for this group beyond the

think within the whether this actually the best
group which discuss the people not
interested having this reinvoke the general
but see why should the issue primarily one
specific
	another issue was the crucification the will god
tragic believe was tragic will can
never accomplished through the disbelief jesus came
this world build the kingdom heaven the
desperately wanted the jewish people accept him the
the crucification was the will god how could jesus pray that this
cup pass from was this out many men and
women have given their lives for their country other noble
jesus less than knew the crucification
was not the will will was that the jewish people accept
jesus the messiah and that the kingdom heaven established
the earth with jesus like the jewish people
this had happened years ago can you imagine what
kind world would live would very different
and that eactly what god men and women that age
could have been saved following the living messiah while was
the jesus could have established sinless lineage that would
have continued his reign after his ascension the spiritual world

two historic facts that think the most important are
jesus rise from the then must have done something
equally order create the observed amount
nobody ever displayed the dead body even though both the
and the roman authorities would have gained lot doing
would have discredited the
and the two simplest refutations are
what the only record impact comes from the new
have guarantee that its books are the least and that
the recorded actually find interesting that other
contemporary source records temple curtain
being the earliest written claim have resurrection
from the pauline none which were written sooner than years
after the supposed
seems probable that one displayed the body jesus because
one knew where personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen
bother with the point about the guards only appears one
and seems like exactly the sort thing early christians might make
order counter the the new testament does
record that jews believed the body had been there were really
they could not have effectively made this they
	should think the serbs doing work
refrained from hope that someone who more familiar with
the than would but this point feel have say
many things about this posting bother know not the slightest
suggestion the that christians should use force propagate the
and the idea that should not concerned about the death
moslems violates the heart the christ died break
down these him there neither jew nor there
neither slave nor there neither male nor
moslems not know may preach but kill
the attack between not
there are christians being attacked one the towns under
attack one the few places where christians and moslems are
living together
the precedents being suggested are from the there are fact two
different things being alluded the first from the entry into
for that would need for god have
promised this land through and would need the war
holy there were tight constraints behavior those
any violations were likely cause the israelites
rape would not have been while the accounts
joshua emphasize towns that were totally note that was
possible for town make peace with the and that once
that was done even when deception was involved they were
expected honor there have been many violations
agreement this see evidence that god has granted
bosnia the serbs promised and their behavior
would have disqualified this from being holy
the other parallel from when israel was defeated
assyria and the prophets saw this judgement israel
for her someone asks whether see this
judgement the bosnians for their this sounds like replay
the old claim that have doctors hospitals because
illness even bad things may used god
for that includes actions bad but that
justify you read the you find them very clear that
attacking the assyrians and babylonians were acting
agents their intent was attack
and they would judged for the fact that they were
actually carrying out plan excuse their
conclude from this that all attacks are
judgements from god explicitly interpreted that through
his far did not send any prophets
while find hard see any good the current
sure god will eventually make good come out but that
justify and save the people who are doing from
particularly concerned about the implications this issue
because current tensions between the west and
what not need for moslems conclude that
christians think kill the implications for the
and even relations with american could quite

	issue was the crucification the will god
tragic believe was tragic will can
accomplished through the disbelief
finished reading very good will
this was very helpful applying thought the subject the
will
weatherhead broke the will god into three distinct
intentional circumstancial and ultimate
also refuted the last statement michael
parkin above quite
the failures ultimate will
never intentions may interfered
even temporarily defeated the will brought down
his ultimate will reconcilication all
will never
time after weatherhead used the cross the best description
this process his were
intentional will was for the live out full life
and perform the work the living the and
deviousness humankind frustrated intent for his
despite the ultimate will was revealed the
jesus willingly but died for
the redemption all the cross was utterly
overcoming even the most cruel
world build the kingdom heaven the
wanted the jewish people accept him the
crucification was the will god how could jesus pray that this
pass from was this out many men and
have given their lives for their country other noble
jesus less than knew the crucification
not the will
was not the intentional will was the circumstancial
thus enabling the victory the ultimate
will was that the jewish people accept
the messiah and that the kingdom heaven established
earth with jesus
intentional
like the jewish people
this had happened years ago can you imagine what
world would live would very different
and that eactly what god men and women that age
have been saved following the living messiah while was
jesus could have established sinless lineage that would
continued his reign after his ascension the spiritual world

what the objection celebration celebration the
resurrection recall command scripture for
celebrate the but the sole and only reason that
are could not celebrate only the name
not quite biblical teaching expects celebrate the
resurrection christ not once year but every time someone
with him wherein also are risen with him
through the faith the operation who hath raised him from the
are buried with him baptism into
that like christ was raised from the dead the glory the
even also should walk newness
those really want celebrate the resurrection should faith walk
newness life after not necessary celebrate pagan
goddess the
see from those who are israel will observe
day the gentiles who believe the messiah israel
welcome observe the day but not required them
the are adopted into the commonwealth the gentiles who
grafted into the commonwealth israel are only required observe
basic commands given those who came before abram also acts
further requirements are placed upon them once they come faith
from this infer that there are different rules for christians jewish
what happened neither jew nor slave nor
male nor for all are one christ jewish
may find certain forms worship and certain disciplines meaningful because
their cultural but have hard time understanding the
justification for applying rules commandments those who have been
justified grace through faith jesus
paul answered your question romans stated that the
the the the giving the the service
and the promises were given the package
goes identify those who are true makes
plain that the true israelites are not those who are born that way but
those who accept the promise paul continued emphasize that
was israelite then gal says that all those
who belong christ are and heirs all the promises
given the the promises come with the all
why that you only want discard one part the
certainly you would want your husband faithful you
believe that adultery longer same

for that stay biblical and call omar rasheet feast
first torah commands that this observed the day following
the sabbath passover any other name modern
why there much objection observing the resurrection
the day the week which actually why jump all
over the calendar the way easter why not just with the sunday
following passover the way the bible has why seek after unbiblical
that the reason easter all over the passsover
itself lunar not solar and thus falls over wide
possible span the few times that easter does not fall during
after passover are because easter further linked the vernal
the beginning
what does this question have with easter whore
all for celebrating the just keep that
whore out the
your obsession with the term clouds your
value not descriptive
this argument illustration the
that the idea that the true
meaning word lies its origins and linguistic our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning word bound with
how not where came very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between and daniel
seagard then for him has that but that highly
idiosyncratic and not one that needs much
	understand who this post directed who are you
trying its subject would assume you are directing
the argument towards people who not believe that christ rose
from the but your you use the bible
the post therefore immediately useless anyone who
believe that the bible unadulterated and everyone
just reaffirmation belief already far
there disagreement between christians over
the resurrection
question what the purpose this

you suggesting that god supports

god who works that way indescribably and unworthy
worship
the bible does tell that governments are ordained god
and god foreknows everything that would
just difficult for humans graps with our limited the
inevitablity the sucess and this especially hard
grasp when see governemnts doing though they are
doing evil should not cooperate with them when they
must understood that what happens what god wanted lead
the final sucess his plan save many souls from hell
the slaughter though deplorable the
eyes god then they might getting their just deserts
now rather than there are plenty examples god killing
people for their sins onan the old testmament for and

plan might
but not unbiblical for god use one nation
execute his just judgement upon the romans were used
fulfill the chorus his blood upon our the crowd
and chaldea was chastised which got
which was inturn gotten god does use nations punish
other the bible very clearly shows the old
you remember the words god recorded
babylon had been weighed the balance scales
found severly and was thus given over the persians
their due punishment for their another exammple the
extirmination the ordered god the task
the cannanites had been given their found severly and
the great carried out his just sentence could
with more but see little need point
quite
two things need remembered all not
question why god has ordered the world his divine
made the world was best his and like paul says romans
the clay not one tlak back the the message
jesus christ for the kingdom heaven
jesus christ did not allow any time for
the dead bury the follow there not infinite
amount rather christ passing right calling people
follow him and become fishers does not
you can call back week and see kingdom fits with your
said his message not just
who would never hurt got all the time the and

the conception mary her
now that defined the immaculate conception doctrine would
possible for those more knowledgeable the area give the biblically
other support for attempted come terms with previously
attempt understand for learning and been able
grasp the
was gift from think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition the church held that mary was also without sin was
the tenets faith particularly with sin was
more and more equated with and thus mary was assumed virgin
for life she never and since she was the spouse
since also had this notion original that man born with
predisposition and since mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever she have original when science
discovered the process the next step was assume that
mary was conceived without original the immaculate
mary that time appeared girl named bernadette she
refered herself the immaculate since nine year old

true and sealed the case for the

	must have missed the postings about david and the second
how does one tell second coming the real unless the
person claiming obviously
first his the messiah comes build the kingdom heaven
the also comes first reveal the root cause
original sin and then provide means cut the
connection that original also wants create world peace
based the teachings will build the foundation
the bible but provide profound new insights into the nature
the fall the purpose and providence
will also provide foundation for the unity all
the
many christians expect jesus come literal they may
miss him when just the jewish people missed jesus
years they are still waiting for his first the jewish
people that age expected elijah come jesus said that
john the baptist was but john the baptist denied that was
did this reflect later prison john even
questioned who jesus the one who come look
for book
not saying that david koresh the second coming how could
somebody who breaks his word the second koresh did promise that
would come out his compound only was allowed give radio
still seems that did fool some
david koresh even come the problem that people like
this make difficult for people believe and trust the real
messiah when does show
from meagre knowledge the seems that christians have
been hard the jews day for being cautious about accepting
somebody that their religious authorities accept the
was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty wanting
early recognize the second coming the same not wanting
credulously believing just anybody who claims
very good point and perhaps the most important point all for
how recognize the second
the messiah should not claim what sets messiah apart
that born without original not born perfect but
achieves perfection after period adam and eve were born
sinless but they and this tragedy meant that would take god
thousands years create the kingdom heaven the earth god
originally restoration providence still not
the messiah the true son one with
representative the but not god there only one
and then any one says here the
there not believe
mark and then they will see the son man coming clouds with
great power and
understanding answer unlike his first
which was the second coming will quite

	the discussion why does the universe exist
must there ask because what you also
assume about that just with
his the question
assume the universe just exists you assume god
why must there the
one the laws specifying cause and effect seems dictate
least this there must causal
reasonable alternative
far can the very laws nature demand that
true something outside nature
may that one day man not only can create life but can also
create see this happening
nor assert but the possibility
given scientists are working hard out
perhaps help cure disease genetic
must there
believe the will entirely deciphered our
but will not see man convert entirely inert material into self
reproducing never been much
even new york mind believe
technology would able produce that necessary despite
having all the parts just
when you say that man have think that you are
presenting unprovable statement you and one
the requires kind taking such hard line
your you may have stumbled into religion your
far can man falls into the
that preposition sort precludes without
absolute what are left believe the word
works
there were something more the man then
have yet find evidence but man
mammal are born mother gives
other mammals are and similar
genetic construction some them
for more this check out
but before you write off all christianity phony and hope
little research into its history and perhaps
reading paul history from your
seems that you have been exposed certain types christian
religion and not even atheist should have enough faith
man know that movement years has have some and
animated some enduring
and islam should fit this bit logic
quite all have all have enduring
thus all must
well with and under investigate
them and discover where god for the denial
god ultimately statement his existence
may

	that within the power each the
that one best friends has become very
that would normally with but
what you exactly mean will
for the time being assume that what you mean that your friend believes
that the bible word suspect that what happened
him what call being was that
the answer all the questions quite
rather give advice your
think been through something similar and one thing can
say that the basic problem that each you are now trying
communicate from different why talks about those things
because they are now what him
not obvious why may very persuasive because
from his point has been sides the this
mean that before turned you two are agreeable
because both you see things from the same
new world reality has suddenly opened like the
discovery say new new
got tell you because has seen something much more wonderful than
where and what thinks much better than where you are
you have got realise that from his point means well
eventhough may end offending worth that
really him respect where you stand
and listen you this may difficult because
either very excited feel too urgent keep quiet
may not realise that really putting you
bible that question how can convince him
this subject better left can preserve
all areas other than religious great
how convince him that
thanks for any
only been trying explain things from his
understand how you feel because christian for good
part life was quite turned off christians
who were really all out and enthusiastic about their
they really scared tell you the
very personal just your agnosticism
also very personal thing since the christian belief
inevitably odds with anything
will touchy like all will take both
sides their part make this maybe you can
your part telling him nicely that you are not able dig what
trying convince you that beyond you not your concern
tell him because him reality
and that would real also have careful not
insult where you stand
like said wish could give your friend some advice
admit that did similarly some friends when became
some wish could have done things little
was difficult then because was excited
and just blabbered away about what was too good
not was and really care most
the time what they you will probably think crazy too
but god very real real you are keep that
and thinks can convince you because since god real
see why god real you
know how helpful this but all the best anyhow

you are using the standard formula fully god and fully
not sure why you object saying that jesus was
the usual analysis would that sin not part the basic
consequence the jesus
but not fallen
differ with our moderator thought the whole idea god coming
down earth live one sin and one
the consecration prayers the book common prayer puts was
that jesus was but did not sin not part the
basic definition then jesus would not
but then the resurrection loses some its
because encounter our humanity most powerfully when distinguish
between and makes jesus less like one the
time need him
issues get mighty when you see people saying different
things often hard tell whether they really mean seriously
different whether they are using different
think any question that there problem with
and would agree that the saying christ had human form
without real human nature will but like
bit wary about the recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not far from
orthodoxy many had nestorius was extreme
representative one the two major schools more
moderate representatives were regarded theodore
impression that the modern monophysite groups
inherit the entire not just and that
some them may have sufficient balanced position regarded
the monophysites inherited none version they
were the opposite end the spectrum from the historical
record suggests that the positions attributed nestorius were not
extreme his opponents wrote the conventional
mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for arguing
think that human could not called mother
the athanasian creed talk about the son surely even
arians would concede that jesus existed long before
opponents claimed that saying mary was not that claimed
that she only gave birth the human nature which would require
two seperate and distinct the argument fails because
mary simply gave birth who preexisted her either
you accept commonly both natures
not sure that not better alternative than
the orthodox after find hard believe that
that human nature was likewise think
rather that god came earth and took our nature upon was seperate
capable being tempted gethsemane believe the divine

may differences what mean the
original complaint was from someone who see how could call
jesus fully because completely agree that
jesus was subject simply object the idea that
not thereby not fully believe that you
not have sin order
again apologize for confusing nestorianism and
agree with and have said that reason think
that not everyone who associated with heretical positions was
fact there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was
not have confess that the first time read some
the correspondence between nestorius and his thought
got the better
most scholars believe that the work that eventually led
chalcedon was and that nestorius was the very least
and the editor christological
refers rejecting all approaches other than his
regular usenet readers narrowness can just much
impediment being did say some things that
think are responds rather mild letter from
cyril with flame worthy says attribute also
the name the characteristics
the flesh that has been conjoined with him
either the work mind which truly errs the fashion the
greeks that mind diseased with the insane heresy arius and
apollinaris and the those who are thus carried away with the
idea this association are because make the divine
logos have part being fed with milk and participate some
degree growh and stand need angelic assistance because his
fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off
the deity and they become the occasion just condemnation for
who perpetrate the
all well and good maintain proper distinction between
humanity and but the whole concept incarnation based
exactly the idea that the divine logos does fact have some
part being growing and course
must understood that certain indirectness the
participation these but there must some sort
identification between the divine and have
incarnation nestorius seemed think black and white
and missed the sorts nuances one needs deal with this
you say find hard believe that that
human nature was think required
orthodox the divine logos that
	than the direct word jesus paul begins
with someone weak the faith you count
one who weak the
you count yourself one who weak the
read word there any doubt your mind
what right and what sin hamartia missing the
there any doubt your mind about what right and what missing
the
like clear that not think unambiguous
that regular christian worship was the first
there are responses both the passages
the ten commandments and words are fairly
are they
are they clear you have
believe that paul can overrule
important first the realization that paul was
paul was writing for largely gentile
and was writing and speaking for audience that was
very weak the most could not most were unfamiliar with
the hebrew scriptures even the septuagint paul adapted the
message the bible largely uneducated this
market still exists but you count yourself part
the not missing the mark you the
best that your education are you doing the
law was regarded jews
the time binding but not there
rules that were binding all human beings noachic
but they are quite
let make clear that the none other than the pentateuch
what did jesus say
about the where did jesus say that the only
applies jews and that gentiles are above the
issue that the church had
after death was what about gentiles who wanted
the decision not impose the law them say
the law was simply acknowledged that fact that
apply
who acknowledged this what are this
why not also acknowledge that the the only
relevant text for after all see the bible that was
magus from the east who observed the why bother
with any texts why not just follow whatever the church has
there contradiction with mat
see how you can say this with straight are you
follower you follow someone are you saying that
the words jesus only apply
far can both paul and other jewish christians did
participate jewish worship the thus they
obey the
how jewish was paul after changed his name from
issue was with gentile
who are not covered the law least not the
aspects
who says gentile christians are not covered the first five who
says that gentile christians are above the ten
dealt mostly with think can reasonably assume that
was directed jewish
implying that words are valid only for this
really what you mean you realize that you are gutting rather
large portions the when you read did you ever
consider that just maybe jesus talking matter what
your race the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts
jesus are only directed why were they translated into
did interact with
few times the centurion whose slave was healed and
the terms used describe the centurion luke
suggest that was gentile who followed
but had not adopted the whole jewish
paul would call one who was weak the
was commended
elders worthy and jesus accepted him
seems indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view
gentiles need not accept the
which more the recorded word jesus indications
that you can deduce from the was jesus god only the
god all humankind all race and
more involved you want compare jesus and paul
order get full picture the role the
come grips with apparent rejection the and
that relates commendation the least
says that the law serves purpose that has been
sense
this your understanding compare this the word
are you christian
this issue one the
the the middle his paul notes
might understood this and assures that not
intends sees the law primarily being
convict people their but ultimately
and one that has been superceded
this your understanding did jesus say that the law
was did jesus say that superceded the
are you christian
comments are not the clearest and not everyone
with
you acknowledge that reading what did jesus
can you deny that quite clear its are you
christian
the interesting thing notice that
this radical position does not entail abolition the
still remains uncompromising from which not iota
dot may for its purpose convicting
that not
when did jesus say that the purpose the law was conviction
for not
end ultimately live not
please reread are you christian
interpretations
the intent the and stay away from the ceremonial
are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial
conclusion while talks about the law being
all the specific examples gives involve the
such circumcision and the quite
about maintaining moral
you call observance the the day which the lord
has circumcision been superceded for
are you christian
there doubt mind about what sin and what
least not this jesus did not deal explicitly with
the question whether the law was binding why
have cite evidence such the way jesus dealt with the
general jewish views dependent largely studies
pauline one and one whose author
come with the both authors are various
christian and jews have discussed the issue here and
other
mat clear that the law still does not say that
applies
and say that the specific requirement for worship the
sabbath the ten commandments ceremonial when
looking the obligations similarly
not sure quite what else can say this
unfortunate the jesus answer the question however
know what the jewish approach how jesus
dealt with least one and how disciples dealt
with the issue when became more acute referring acts

yes and hell eternal the way

where sinners will feel the licking flames
supposedly can feel these would assume still

the papacy and this matter then the
pope cannot the other this not matter
but matter church then should still obey the
pope the legal head the
other given the doctrine have choice
but
this primary problem the church what you are saying
more less you might call the
idea that the pope always right everything says
this virtually all over the especially this
the pope only infallible under certain very specific and
when these conditions are not can
make can make
couple historical examples come
bishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product the
english catholic one point during his the reigning
pope decided install one his nephews english bishop
grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body
maybe not many you have treat popes with even
when they are the problem was that this nephew would just
collect the income the and probably never set foot
this would deprive the people the see bishop
grosseteste was quite right what
another example that pope john pope the middle
decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatific
vision until the last decided that this should
defined doctrine the though quite get around
defining now way this compatible with catholic
the doctrine was criticised many the
went far put number his opponents
the had admit his shortly before
his successor made the exact idea dogma the
you consult any the great catholic theologians who treat such
such robert bellarmine doctor the you
will find detailed discussions whether the pope can personally fall
into heresy
the teaching all such theologians that the commands pope
must resisted they are the detriment the catholic
authority given for the purpose building the
catholic commands conflict with this purpose have
legal moral
	have been following this thread
and here with amazed
the different argument those who oppose the sabbath
one question comes especially since last one was not answered
from maybe clh may wish provide the first
there lot talk about the sabbath the being
answer
since the commandments one law with ten parts what biblical
basis have you decided that only the sabbath portion
you say that the the sabbath but not applicable
gentile does that mean the sabbath commandment has been
references
god did not intend his requirements the jews applicable
gentile christians why did make plain that the gentiles were now
grafted into the commonwealth
darius
rom col gal believe gotten into
loop this this one those classic situations where
both sides think they have clear scriptural and
obvious argument that going change think
going anything but repeating
	deletion unnecessary
that have this notion that god takes some sort pleasure
punishing the purpose hell destroy the devil and
first god does not take any sort pleasure from punishing
will have mercy whom will have mercy and compassion
whom will have compassion enjoyed
punishing people and sending them then why would send jesus
and save that which was
the earlier poster who tried support the eternal hell theory with
fact that the fallen angels were not remember the bible
that god has reserved them until the day their
soon
suggest maybe those who believe the eternal hell theory
provide all the biblical evidence they can find for stay away
human and only take into account references the
you asked for
peter talks about how those who are ungodly are
matthew also very clear that those who not righteous
eyes will sent hell for
thessalonians states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence the
thessalonians talks about those who refuse love the truth
being
revelation talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who those who listed verse will
the lake burning
revelation gives the indication that those who follow the beast
tormented with burning and there being rest day
for them because
psalm wicked return the all the nations that
forget
think those should sufficient prove the
joe fisher
the following mostly playing not
advocating either concern that people understand that
possible see these passages different possible
see eternal destruction just that rev often
uses the term the most obvious understanding that
would seem final the problem that the speaks
both eternal punishment and second uses terms
that can understood either concern here not convince
you one view the but help people understand that
wide enough variety images that possible
understand them either tom albrecht the primary
point our best keep people out the eternal
whatever the make things more luke
implies that the damned get resurrected presumably
they just stay yes aware that possible
understand this passage
peter talking about and talks about holding them
hell until the final this eternal
matthew talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his the fact that the fire
eternal mean that people will last its flames
particularly interesting the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his rev and talk about the
eternal fire they say that the beast and the false prophet
will tormented forever when talking about people being
thrown into referred second
this sounds more like extinction than eternal possible
that the fire has different effects supernatural entities such
the and
thessalonians what
this not necessarily eternal this one can clearly
understood either but think least possible think
that everlasting being used contrast the kind destruction
that can occur this life with the final destruction that occurs
thessalonians again talks about
revelation see comment above
revelation probably the best the even
explicitly say that the people suffer says
that the smoke presumably the and that
there respite from but say that the people
are tormented
psalm see that says anything relevant this
	for why does the universe exist
there not have find this
there why and spend our lives then have merely
our which were meaningless there why and
the universe billion years and suppose lasts another
billion suppose live that that small
searching for the along with friends here
earth nothing else
find this view christianity quite disheartening and
the idea that life only has meaning importance there creator
does not seem like much basis for
and the logic also must exist because want him
have heard this line before and wonder how prevalent
certainly modern society many people are convinced life
hopeless the pollsters and newscasts but see
where this good reason become you want
why not just join such the leaders will give you
the security blanket you
	what our moderator has already answered the charge
arrogance more ably that could have done will confine
myself answering the charge
think belief right and everyone belief
have this simply what belief
this seems how christians are taught think when
comes their
this how everyone the western intellectual tradition
taught the fundamental premis not thing
true then its converse necessarilly without this basic
asumption theology and science know them are alike
should distinguish the strong and weak meanings the word
the weak sense means not believe tom went
the could have gone the the strong sense
means certain that use basis believe
that nature operates according certain fundamental
the fact that nature capricious and christian
belief the strong christians may well hold beliefs
the weak kind any number theological and ecclesiological
take the extreme and say that
religion the only one and you accept their teachings
you
note that these are two separate most hold the first but the
majority not hold the again matter pure logic that
christanity then hinduism must necessarilly
insofar contradicts incompatible
matter vice
takes quite bit arrogance claim
know what god
arrogant claim know what thinks unless
they have told christians believe god has told what thinks
and
when based upon your
most christians not base their belief the but the living
tradition the church established christ and guided constantly
the holy the bible simply the written core that
logic the above statement faulty
that assumes two people with differing beliefs both
depends what you mean believe tom six feet
tall and you believe weighs our beliefs but
may both believe tom six feet tall and you beleive
that four foot one must
all about two people are exactly
two people perceive everything the same believe that
one call universal call
you believe god presents this think
there and you look for and see through
dreams just because people may
this truth mean one wrong and the
thus you believe that there single truth but that human being
can find you assert that anyone who believe that can find
absolute truth you believe that anyone who
does not share your belief this point
take the the glass half
half you can have two different answers which are
and yet both are for your belief
does not require everyone belief
here begin suspect that your real difficulty not with the
knowability but simply with saying that the glass
half empty not contradiction the statement that half
the same fact expressed different whole
point this phrase illustrate the different ways the pessimist
and the optimist express the
quite true that different people may express the
same belief different also true that they may fail
understand each words expressions the same belief
and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles great
scisms have occurred just this and much ecumenical work has
been done simply resolving differences language which conceal
agreement this does not any that all beliefs
are equally since some the beliefs people hold contradict
some other beliefs that other people after all obfuscations
language and culture the expression those beliefs have
been stripped some the beliefs that some people hold
and neither arrogant nor illogical
say believe and you believe may both
but equivalent then one wrong and long
hold our respective must each regard the other

wife and catholic the last
years seems that there are more and more hoc events during
driving the most aspect liturgical tradition
that what happens something because all know how
led the which makes kind dialogue
present but the best masses been were participatory
the one hand there are advantages having the liturgy stay the
john has described some the other some people
seem start tuning out same old and pay attention better
when things get changed think innovative priests and liturgy
committees are trying get our attention and make things more
meaningful for drives crazy
different people have differing preferences and needs
local parish prefer mass the next parish
sometimes have the option attending mass the
style which best suits john put smiley but offer
probably the
related that sounds like john does not have deal
that spouses may have different liturgical husband does like
innovative challenge meet both our spiritual
needs without just going our separate when you include the factor
also trying satisfy our things get pretty
one thing remember that even the most uncongenial mass still
	environmentalism and paganism
would like see christians devote bit less effort
and more figuring out how present the gospel
the the pagans have lot the right
who deny the need for any

	response some the discussions the andrew byler
commented that really followed sola scriptura would worship
saturday the change sunday was law made the and
acknowledge its authority make noted that
protestants not consider sunday worship
was not referring the faq but the five sabbath admissions posted
the bible study this what prompted someone send the faq
the argument against the sabbath
that part the ceremonial and like the rest the
ceremonial law not binding
you cannot from that the weekly sabbath part the
ceremonial before you post text reply investigate its
you accept that
the sabbath not binding then the day worship
falls into the category items which individual christians
worship its nature group churches are free
can the churches also decide what and not where
there divine imperative course must establish rules
but cannot creative with what god has explicitly
spoken
darius
the normal protestant sunday not
and worshipping another day not churches are free
decide the day they will just they are free decide
the would not sin worship some other but
you belong church that worships sunday and you show
you will probably worship
	phil sells
probably tired old maybe with slightly different
wanted know there are any good texts
for learning ancient and how these compare with german
educational texts anybody has figure
out should buy one here for later study wait until get back
the
impression that advanced you will much better off with
german reference works concordances for
preference would deal with textbook written
native but you know german and are pick all the
reference books you think you can only know these works
since german most but look the following
the jenni westermann theological
dictionary the
like divinity schools seminaries the
there lot language instruction really have basis
for
the amount language instruction available seminaries varies
mostly depending the denominational heritage the presbyterian
and reformed seminaries probably place lot more emphasis the biblical
languages than any divinity school that has doctoral
program biblical studies going have extensive language but
there are quite few seminaries here which the
attitude seems interested give you
but understand why
the pattern here the louisville presbyterian seminary for
students take intensive introductory language courses each
followed exegesis hebrew
exegesis the greek exegesis the
these courses are required for third half the
take advanced biblical work that requires language
	really trying situation that you have
brother was living with someone like that and things were almost bad
left after considerably shorter amount time due
other problems with the the best thing
would get everyone the same room together room
with nothing lock the door behind throw the key out
underneath the door far the longest hand can you
would like get out after the would and hash
things more than there will and
possibly hitting course someone decided bring some rope
tie people some the best strategies keeping things calmer
would
have each individual own their own statements feel that this
relationship hurting everyone involved really
understand where coming
reinforce statements you think that
did this because let just say that the reason for this
was
accuse each other was your fault that
find common ground about something really are
decorational and functional the same
situation like there going some
gunnysacking topics which were assumed but were
truly not and someone feels someone else this
should kept minimum and simply ask for forgiveness apologize
about each situation without holding smoldering
the relationship really can just matter keeping things
smooth and sort like making peace treaty between
warring you give one side there must
breaks can but communication between everyone
involved must continue the relationships here are
joe fisher
	true and false
not solely matter the nature
commands must also taken into not enough
compliance refusal and then say whether they are
you also have take into consideration
the commands are good
you ask where would echo that not trying
but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction
and what authority you rely upon for your
what prevents from choosing any doctrine like and saying that
papal disagreement error that will resolved
this especially since councils bishops have basically
stood the
appears that much what lies the heart this matter
disagreements over what tradition and and also over
authority and
question the supporters sspx
there any way that your positions with respect church reforms
could change and conformed those the that
the position does not change and that the leaders sspx
jointly make such
this appears claiming infallible teaching
adopt the view that not and
way change you must change that
either left the catholic church has left
the orthodox church does not recognize papal
viewing authority present each and ecumenical
regard the subsequent development the doctrines
regarding papal authority and jurisdiction separation
the bishop rome from the orthodox without going into
the merits the great least the orthodox agree that
split and paly what appear semantic games
like the but recognize that what does
words appears facto
where are are another arian complete with weak
are the sspx priests modern martin the only
answer that examine who saying and what the
teaching the church
sould argue from now until the second coming about what the
traditional teaching the church this were simple matter
east and west would not have been separated for over
catholics will decide side with the there some
because the papacy eventually
pope straighten all this
thought that the teaching magisterieum the church did not allow
error teachings regarding faith and morals even the short
may wrong not roman
what would the effect pope making cathedra statement
regarding the sspx would how
you get around the formal doctrine
not trying trying
since got real vested interest the
one way the
superset disobedience obey legitimate
all schismatics are but
work the other way not all disobeyers are
the mere fact that the sspx priests comply with
holy desires make them
does the command was sspx does not view the
commands this very slippery
but problem with this
according the traditional theology holy episcopal
does not confer only confers the power
the ability confect the
true
jurisdiction must
someone else with the power confer the
the society knowing the traditional theology quite
take great pains avoid any pretence jurisdiction over
they simply confer those sacraments that require

new and only vaguely but want
know what some you people are there
infinite number and person goes the one that
simply heaven nothing
are those around has there always
been some unchanging the childhood taken
into
sure these must sound like
most but figure that the
area which christians not suspect
because our primary source information prophets and
and their writings tend highly however
both teachings the gospels and books such the revelation
john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal number occasions jesus does say things that
imply some sort and number
similar passages where jesus says things like xxx will better
off than you the cor talks about someone who
gets into but the skin his but these
passages are not normally interpreted suggesting separate
much differing levels prestige punishment heaven
hell not all christians would even far the only
christian group know that believes multiple heavens the
and they are very far from mainstream christianity
enough that many our readers would not call them their
ideas this area involve specific mormon addition
the bible and more generic christian
note that many christians will cringe the very thought
associating grading with the whole point christ was free
from the results test that possibly you
like test god grades very strict and unbending
but also cheats replaces our test papers with exam that
was prepared the before actually doing the
because some people end heaven and others easy
see why inclined think while there are
differences among branches christianity think all
agree that one way god
personally very sceptical about anyone who claims know exactly
how far cheating will accept people who
explicitly acknowledge but somehow still follow him their
many christians believe that this least
but certainly not all jesus provided with clear
description how but not clear that
provided exact description how going place the dividing
certainly made clear that expect know whether
other individuals are saved

conveys all the truth that this has done
which version the bible the perfectly preserved and
why are there many translations that are not perfectly
god trying confuse
changes wording even accidental omission passages some
does not change the truth being nor would lead
student into doctrinal also that god provided many
but that exactly what there are many branches
denominations christianity and deviations doctrine portruding
from varying translations biblical texts that
are much too numerous begin there perfect
then there would possible misinterpretation and there would
need for anyone here debating the other maybe
the bible but one this planet perfect enough
read but then there would point god giving
something cannot use
you attack the credibility and reliability the you
weak the only reason that can see for wanting
remove the bible the final and instead put
responsibility men sift the bible strain out the nuggets
that contains other what they want and
the the bible does not just contain
you trust your salvation the reliability single
you are weak the beginning was the and
the word was with and the word was this word existed before
the bible was word this word that john

	are atheists believes could the result
condescending best and slightly disquised hominem
this attitude the part many especially the
one reason for the hostility you how you
when atheists say that people turn religion out
agree you are going find out anything from people who
share your not attack them condescend them and hope
get neutral picture come them with open
believe that atheists are generally any more
anybody any cause and effect likely the
there emotional price pay for being
beliefs lack and
and character
you believe see even sort
negative connotation mean simply that
you believe that god christians can also feel that
sense when they are associated with
weird televangelists who always talk about excuse
the cliched sound everyone has deal with her
differences from other can understand how being atheist
could hard for being christian sometimes hard for
became atheist when got old enough reason because there
just good reason believe the religion had been
was very painful because the pressure was placed under
family and wanted fit and
but finally the cognitive dissonance was just too
you should not have repress how you feel you should able
discuss without think there are admirable things learn
from any which can enrich your own asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask can learn the answers and become
stronger faith support knowing the answers
those weak and
have sympathy for gays growing repressive environments and
hide and sometimes first try deny part themselves
been only case was rationality instead
sexuality which was forced try
some way the pressures were because you
your beliefs are you saying that they were not your
but born flames about whether
not gay people their lifestyle elsewhere this
must say that
hurt experiences church any more than some friends
become was just hurt
not sure understand this sentence could you
points out that most atheists they
just cease believiing
consider also that people like pat robertson and many the
extremists naturally evoke
their attacks anyone who disagrees and their attempts
force their views you are known the company you
trying preach should not surprised
part being christian accepting with
open heart including people own with whom
completely the same believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way reach out those not our
nor effective try browbeat people into accepting our
have different idea what
christian who happy her and others see that and want
know about either the happiness the share what
know without pressure and let them make their own some
point you just have agree disagree acceptance

own disclaimer what
breastplate there
	basic problem with your argument your total and complete reliance
biblical account highly suspect would refer you
hermeneia commentary moreover account written
years after the the meantime everyone mentions has died
attempts find actual written sources behind the text have come
only the section the later portion acts firmly
pauls account some the events acts recorded
fail establish the acts
even there was independent proof that account was
find strange that you would take the negation
truth without any direct historical evidence least that
back the assertion was unequivocally
that christian ever sufferred for their faith believing
the account suggests and the
absence direct eyewitnesses who can claim that luke
then suggest that this unequivocal assertion
westpark
think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than
was answer the claim that the witnesses
lying because they were willign suffer for their
thus not necessary show that christian ever suffered
for believing the rather the issue whether
those who witnessed
agree that the posting responding shows that there
can liberal well conservative
	heard said that the accounts have christs life and
ministry the gospels were actually written many years after the
years this why the big time
know all scripture inspired the time writing suppose
but still help
ivan thomas barr
gospels can only prolog
about the only thing have from the author describing his
the prolog sounds like luke from the next and had
some there are traditions passed down verbally that
say few things about the composition the there are
debates about how reliable these traditions they certainly
have the status yet scholars tend take some them
one suggests that mark was based and
was written preserve them when peter had died way about
one tradition about matthew suggests that collection jesus words
may have been made earlier than the current
the ancient was much more common rely verbal
transmission think many people would have preferred
hear about jesus directly from someone who had known and maybe
even from someone who studied directly under such rather
than from thus suspect that the gospels are largely from
period when these people were beginning scholars generally
think there was some written material which was probably used
sources for the existing
establishing the dates complex and technical have
confess that not sure how much reliance put the methods
but common think that mark was written around
and that all the gospels were written the end the
few people vary this decade one way the

jack
	like share thoughts this topic
and look forward any
encounters with find myself dismayed their
belief that their faith total according
their beliefs come from the bible and the bible the word
god and god truth thus they know the this stance
makes difficult discuss other faiths with them and own
hesitations about christianity because they see other
their way the
but see their faith arising from willful choice believe
particular that choice part faith and part
but seems
discussions with some christians remind schoolyard
discussions when was grade
kid would policemen are
you daddy told you know
daddy says always
well the argument usually stops right the
all just groping for the have
the authority declare all other beliefs besides our own
this only third time browsing through this
apologize covering tired old some the
discussions this topic have piqued interest and welcome
any
louis kim
southwest research institute
sort mystified about how christian might respond
can understand criticisms christianity that say not enough
evidence believe that just good evidence for
other but clearly there are plenty
intelligent people who find the evidence but that
seem your you seem upset that people who
believe christianity true also believe that things which contradict
are
this suggests model spiritual things rather different than
the christian sounds more like existentialist where
people choose what value but actual independent
spiritual and way say that specific choice
some unique sense this sort model with modifications
one sort another may appropriate for some but
christianity its essense that
based the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out
that one them has intervened history specific
and that see evidence that the
are not free choose how things when drop
falls from situations where the
christian concept that spiritual there also actual
external hope all honest enough not claim that
have perfect but while may not think know
are confident that know some and that
implies that think things that contradict them are
see how else could
this result certainly interested talking
with people other they may have things teach and
even they respect them fellow human but
got possible respect people and also think that some
matters they are maybe even disasterously
	family has never been particularly religious singing christmas
carols about the limit for thus never really believed god and
although actually believe that they exist either
sort probably like lot people
lately been thinking about all lot and wondered how
religious people can convinced that there feel though
want but not used believing things without proof
just believe that there definitely
definitely believe that there wondered most you were brought
religious families and never believed any can anyone help
understand how your belief and faith god can
another question that frequently crosses mind which religion
how you choose and how you know that the christian
god exists and the gods other religions how you feel about
people who follow other how about and people like
agnostics you respect their and accept their
beliefs just valid your there contradiction between
the how can your religion more valid than any
you have less respect for someone not they follow
different religion than you would they were
how much the scriptures are are all events
the bible really supposed have are they just supposed
stories with morals showing true christian how
generally follow most the christian which suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions not and
for want better the only part find
hard the actual belief
what attitude people like who quite
believe but are generally fairly surely not
believing make worse find myself wondering why
strongly want really and find
sorry waffled bit was just writing ideas they came
into sure probably repeated myself bit
thanks for the

been enough discussion about evidence for christianity
recently that you may prefer respond this via email rather than

recall watt making comment this though was quite few
years back and cite the also recall that cecil who
was secretary the interior during the carter responded
comments pointing out the stewardship role that god gave
recorded which makes who are the
true seems that should want
things value for societal this form
should logically extend the physical environment
which people well the moral environment which they relate

although the bodily assumption has basis
carl jung declared one the most important
the church recent that implied the inclusion the
into the
which means has absolutely idea about what the assumption
however greatly extoll quite obvious that she
way god even part god equal the assumption our
blessed meant that because her close identification with the
redemptive work she was assumed that she did not
body and soul into and thus one the along
with moses who are already perfected
the virgin mary far superior glorification
any the previously mentioned
jung should stick psychology rather than getting into
andy byler
	although the bodily assumption has basis
carl jung declared one the most important pronouncements
the church recent that implied the inclusion the
into the
what did jung mean
	find interesting that cls never answered any the questions
goes the make statements which make has
one set rules for the jews
another set for the saved gentiles why would god
does the jew who accepts jesus now have live under the
has one set rules for all his paul was never against the
fact says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls
point germane both jews and the law can
used instrument and please not combine
ceremonial and moral laws
matt christ plainly says what came and you say was
saying that for the your christ must
speaking from both sides his paul have
learned forget all the just what jesus
your excuses will not hold court law far less
judgement
pardon for being little but the beginning your second
you has one set rules for all his yet the
end the same paragraph you not combine the ceremonial
and moral laws not only not understand where the bible you
find the declaration that there are laws and but
also unclear whether you think bad have sets laws the first
bad have sets how can there ceremonial law
that different from the moral law vice
would also interested your comments the passage
where paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying
depending whether you are man you think the apostles can
prescribe different sets rules for men and then why not for
jews and why did who was opposed circumcising
voluntarily circumcise
mark
	have seen two common threads running through postings atheists the
and think that they can used explain each
have direct quotes
atheists believe that when they they die
god who would condemn those who fail believe him eternal death
see what the problem hell
what atheists are expecting when they
this the this not this permanent
indeed what atheists expect and neither fair nor
just you might well argue about whether being made
mostly carbon and water
the atheists who claim that hell unfair are talking about
the fire and brimstone place endless which necessarily
includes eternal existance but some sort
not all the same
you clearly feel that but this not univeral
sentiment near can
idea god heathens ordinary have
problem with have problem with the gods that hide from humans
and torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing
and
dan johnson
and god said this and genesis
these opinions probably show what
	christian
name have sister birthday
used fire for the but for some she
became want associate anymore with her old
christian thought maybe some you could help her
out again sending her postcard card with little message
written address hobart
san jose
thank you and god
jesus christ
have some qualms about postings like you might want
engage bit more conversation with joel before deluging
someone who expect with
	not the position that there proof the
much some people accept their their priests
straight from their own scriptures the this does not
you fully explained the atheist many theists believe that
there proof the existence but choose believe him
yet found argument for atheism that quickly
broken down unprovable this problem with
needs have but you believe that you can provide
argument for the nonexistence really like see
you asking believe you are trying deny that part
that makes ask the question god and
not use our ability reason become ignorant
the other animals this does god want like
are right that science and reason cannot prove
not use them can only then believe faith and since
can only use why one picture any less
than another
when you use science and you have faith certain beliefs
the scientific
the physical laws the universe are
our observations reality are valid basis for determination
objective reality
logical argument valid way answer all
can you prove any
alan the scorpion
oakland
	also cannot fail note the intense suffering devastation which has been
wrecked our world because christians who were certain they were
following from captialist who have polluted the enviorment strict
obedience the gensis command subdue the who have
punished the jews for the killing christ well the other the
innocent women who were burned alive accordance with shall not allow
witch the moslems who were killed the the
men destroyed the the religious wars
christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss
life individuals whose certainity that they were following the
instructions was there much
randy
very but also believe that you have presented
misleading christianity not the cause the massacres
and horrific injustices that you rather they are the fault
people who misunderstand jesus and modify
suit their own beliefs and rather than alter their
ambitions more line with those presented desirable
the new with every truthful and good message that
carries authority implied comes the inevitable
fact that some people will understand distorted
with inevitable
the message that are love all and
that all people are preaches message
and all people have
deceitful and are capable turning this message
around and contorting sometimes unbelievable
this also fundamental christian
one the problems that you look the world through
the eyes western think that you will find
many cases massacres that were instigated
people who never claimed they were not saying
this justify the massacres that but merely
pointing you tendency which present humans
consider the world without doubt that
would have the same freedoms the countries which
for the peaceful doctrines jesus
perhaps would even confronted very harsh religion
name any though one comes which
would not even allow the freedom speech debate such
point the blame inherent human tendencies thirst for
greed and please point the blame
message which preaches fundamental giving and
love for
yours
andrew mcveigh
believe that line questioning like you presented
strangely compatible with becoming
certainly christianity encourages one question the behaviour
the and especially praise god for
jesus and the fact that can doubt our beliefs
and still come back god and time and time
andrew mcveigh
	would like get your opinions when exactly does engaged
couple become some say that the two have
publically announced their plans have made their vows and
are unswervingly committed one another realize this subjective
they are
suppose they are unable get before the altar right the current time
because purely logistical reasons beyond their what you
think about
post with general you need clarification
what please
thanks and god
robert anderson iii
	course they knew where forget that jesus was seen both
the jews and the romans pilate was fool and
need the additional headaches some fishermen stealing body
make appear had since jesus was buried the grave
man well know the say that they know where was
buried begs the
here the problem with most the individuals posting you take the
biblical account though were some sort historical recounting the
modern would refer you john dominic crossans book cross that
harper and the earliest texts which have make
reference empty nor empty tomb necessary for claim
modern have completely missed what
the point resurrection here the work george work
and eternal life intertestamental
havard most look rom paul
here has need empty additionally cor here again there
mention empty was raised the
ascension
resurrection could accomplished without ever disturbing the bones the
the whole idea empty tomb broached any our texts
until well after the fall that the idea coming
with body would have been moreover mack has argued
that the empty tomb story first appears mark have texts
before this which mention the
you say that you think that the disciples stole the but think
this would you die maintain something you knew
deliberate then why you think the disciples
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe the
but unbeknown many have done talking about
for something you know
you position with regards the disciples stealing the
body seems rather lightweight
for why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over
the body buried with great this
argument that can
that leaves you back square what happened the
let comment that the most plausible
and the one typically suggested sceptics who are knowledgeable
about the that the resurrection was subjective and the
empty tomb stories are result accounts growing the
you are quite right even the idea subjective mystical event the
foundation the resurrection narratives currently becoming more
see mack myth
randy
	please realize that frequently getting trouble for
straying from but here
moreover the buddha says that are
intrinsically good against are all
never thought these two ideas being each
people might quibble about what means but the
reason are sinners because not behave good
the message christ that each are not only
but that can approach albeit perhaps through
different technique than you claim buddhism because
not realize our peter had problem walking
water until little doubt crept
david ask the psalm man that you
should care for but you have made him just little lower
than the
probably exagerate mind what scrawny little kid david
just probably exagerate what gigantic monster goliath
but power easily defeated
remember the rich young man who comes jesus and asks what
can enter the jesus says follow the
always picture the smug look his face says done that
his whole probably anticipating from the
instead jesus gives him harder sell everything
and follow jesus raising the the desciples say
how can anyone this hard even for rich
jesus says anyone can with
jesus says not only can avoid killing can avoid
getting angry not only can avoid committing
can control our own
realize this was not your main but wonder how other
people see
you have become christian you had not
been indoctrinated your you probably never learned about
any other religion make comparative and therefore claim
you are brain
forgive any generalizations about
your point about how other religions are good just
your tough think that muslims
worship the same god can learn from their name
hindus and buddhists and claim that
god personal say but think little
more answer whichever think greater
personal with individual but
right that that might cultural think more
must admit that personal nature far beyond
conception his impersonal nature beyond the
somehow jesus could fit into hindu cosmology
then maybe have though that hard
are there any former members here
who could
chris mussack
	deleted much the following article order discuss the
specific issue whether acceptable
the she was wonderful and
husband and gave birth two everything was not
for since she could never open the deepest part her
her she always found that she could much closer
women friends than her good and loing husband
might she struggled very much with this until the age she
that she was when she came home announce this
her husband told her that had come the same
several years before and was waiting for her come that
her own her children ages and the time were
extremely supportive the youngest put just
that you love people very jane and her husband agreed
but remain friends and still consider each other part the
family this
the interesting things that jane said this whole discussion was
not about what goes the she found that
was much more able have committed relationship with woman
her only part the whole
key thing how one interconnects with other she made
point say that was not that she had never met good
she was married wonderful man for dozen few
and honestly ponder that thought and
have thought about the and
have whole generation families broken because some men have
decided that okay leave their wives and children for the
thrill more attractive accept that
legitimate for jane have how can not accept
decision divorce because has found someone with whom can
have more committed
marriage not state mutual journey
love not passive must actively
acceptable for older executive dump his wife many
years who stayed home care for the children because
happy sexually unless with beautiful
young the real solution for both the couple
make renewed
hold fast the has not the lord repeatedly compared his
relation his people faithful and enduring
learn something very deep and very mystical when marry and
remain faithful through times
spouse has brain tumor that has left her partially
were resume growing thanks
then perhaps the time would come when could not have sexual
lord would certainly not give
permission seek someone else satisfy
the idea that alright divorce couple
seems lead such monstrous destruction the meaning
marriage that feel must make every effort avoid any hint
have become petty and that
some husbands are threatening divorce their wives unless the
wives lose
praise the lord for guiding marry she married
anyway despite the possibility that could have terrible
and turned out that she was the one with the brain but
had known have cared and maybe
car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck
married couple should deal with these situations with the help
the not divorce and run away from
	matter what system explanation creation you wish
you always have start with one two creation
from creation from there are other
and accept one the other those two
then again there are two either creation was
was according some
was unable accept that the complex nature
our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures
could exist they therefore left with creation under the
control intelligence capable devising such call
that intelligence
also prefer the rather than from
there obviously way prove either are and
must have come from choose whatever explanation you
feel most comfortable you are the one who has live

len howard
	now the opinion that you saved through faith alone what you
taught but how can square mind the teachings james
conjunction with the lukewarm christian being
you agree that good works have role you will
generally find yourself one two
faith works salvation
faith salvation works
either works are required for faith will
inevitably result good
also the opinion that salvation faith based
ephesians and romans also conclude that james when
read teaching bullet when james speaks
would claim that not speaking god declaring
the believing sinner innocent his sight use the
instead speaking the profession faith being
the display good also according
james the abscence such works evidence for
faith which fails
james not problem for the doctrine salvation faith
teaching works would have their not merit toward
but evidence true
dave weaver fool who gives what cannot keep
are course number other the reformers
believed
salvation faith works
some suspect that the three things are tied together such way
that diagram this form can
	velasco
all truths also
all scripture truths therefore
the answer both questions
absolute something that constant across
true every instance you agree
this
agree with your
women covering their heads and not
hold said that all scripture discerning
exactly what paul and company were trying say not always
believe that paul was trying say that all women should
behave that was trying say that under the circumstances
the the women was speaking would best avoid volubility and
cover their this has with maintaining proper witness toward
remember that any number relativistic statements can derived
from for absolutely right for christians
strive for this does not rule out trying maintain world
peace resorting violence
agree that there truth there are principles
learned from claiming that that truth seems
imply literal reading the were absolute truth
across then interpretation would
may that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different
from person that mean that one person
right and the other believe that god transcends our simple
and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly
this god knows and knows that needs are different
from yours anyone claiming that scripture
then least one person every disputed interpretation must
just believe that god that
are clearly not taking this particular part scripture
absolute there are plenty other
you reconcile
the bible preaches absolute exactly what those
truths are sometimes matter the bible does
preach absolute sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear least
this where the arrogance comes since these principles
are crystal clear maybe the rest should just take
their word for maybe all crystal clear that
their fundamental principles are either fundamental
think established that figuring out biblical truth matter
human interpretation and therefore yet you can still
claim that some them may crystal maybe certain
segment but
very difficult see how you can claim something which based
your own
god revealed his truths the through his utterly
that some people whill come with alternate
practically anything can especially
when comes matters right and care deny
not think supports position much more effectively
than
think that your position
the bible absolute but are prone error our
cannot reliably determine have figured out
what that truth
did get that
the point spending all this time claiming and defending
absolute when can never know what those truths and
can never least act upon what practical
difference can this
carol alvin
	probably tired old maybe with slightly different
wanted know there are any good texts
for learning ancient and how these compare with german
educational texts anybody has figure
out should buy one here for later study wait until get back
the
something find interesting about studying theology germany the
fact that the students get their ancient out the
way early not theology but spend lot time with
such their they take the first two years just
greek and latin and hebrew
like divinity schools seminaries the
there lot language instruction really have basis
for
phil
philip sells anything too hard for the
better have the tradition classical
education the generally seminary believes students
should know they have teach common for seminaries
require least semester each hebrew and though
course more required for serious
